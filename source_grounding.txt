- "Combined cruise efficiency η_cruise = 0.4436"
  Source: Calculated from @eq:cruise-efficiency
  Calculation: η_cruise = η_prop × η_motor × η_ESC = 0.55 × 0.85 × 0.95 = 0.4436
  Inputs: From @tbl:efficiency-parameters

- "Fixed-wing takeoff ground roll ≈ 536 m"
  Source: Estimated using standard ground roll analysis

### Section 5.3: Hybrid VTOL configuration (@sec:hybrid-vtol-analysis)
[UPDATED 2025-12-30: Corrected values for 2 min hover + 1 min transition model]

- "QuadPlane (L/D) = 10.52 (90% of pure fixed-wing due to stopped rotor drag)"
  Source: Estimated drag penalty from [@bertaniPreliminaryDesignFixedwing2023]
  Calculation: (L/D)_QP = 0.90 × 11.68 = 10.51 ≈ 10.52
  Note: 5-10% drag increase from stopped rotor pods

- "Cruise power P_cruise = 318 W for QuadPlane"
  Source: Calculated from @eq:cruise-power-qp
  Calculation: P = W × V / ((L/D) × η_cruise) = 37.11 × 40 / (10.52 × 0.4436) = 317.9 W

- "Hover time allocation: 2 min (120 s)"
  Source: Engineering estimate based on Earth QuadPlane operations
  Reference: [@goetzendorf-grabowskiOptimizationEnergyConsumption2022]
  Note: Paper indicates ~2 min total VTOL time including transitions;
        ~20s takeoff climb, ~10-15s landing descent, remainder for station-keeping

- "Transition time allocation: 1 min (60 s = 2 × 30 s)"
  Source: Engineering estimate
  Reference: [@mathurMultiModeFlightSimulation2025; @zhaoDevelopmentMultimodeFlight2023]
  Note: 30s per transition is a conservative estimate; actual transition time
        depends on transition corridor and control strategy

- "Hover energy consumption E_hover = 106.0 Wh (2 min)"
  Source: Calculated from P_hover × t_hover
  Calculation: E = 3178 W × (120 s / 3600 s/h) = 106.0 Wh

- "Transition energy E_transition = 25.0 Wh (2 transitions)"
  Source: Scaled from [@goetzendorf-grabowskiOptimizationEnergyConsumption2022]
  Reference value: ~45 kJ per transition for 10 kg quad-plane
  Calculation: E = 2 × 45000 J / 3600 J/Wh = 25.0 Wh
  Note: Simplified energy-only model with linear mass scaling;
        does not capture peak power or transition corridor constraints

- "Cruise energy consumption E_cruise = 302.0 Wh (57 min)"
  Source: Calculated from P_cruise × t_cruise
  Calculation: E = 317.9 W × (57 min / 60 min/h) = 302.0 Wh

- "Mission energy = 433.0 Wh (hover + transition + cruise)"
  Source: Calculated sum of flight phase energies
  Calculation: E_mission = 106.0 + 25.0 + 302.0 = 433.0 Wh

- "Required energy with 20% reserve = 519.6 Wh"
  Source: Calculated from @eq:energy-required-total
  Calculation: E_req = 1.20 × 433.0 = 519.6 Wh

- "Energy margin = 38.2%"
  Source: Calculated from available vs required energy
  Calculation: Margin = (718.2 - 519.6) / 519.6 = 0.382 = 38.2%

- "Lift system mass penalty = 1.700 kg (17.0% of MTOW)"
  Source: Estimated from commercial QuadPlane reference data
  Components: Motors 1.0 kg, ESCs 0.24 kg, Propellers 0.16 kg, Structure 0.30 kg
  Reference: Analysis of reference_drones.yaml specifications

- "QuadPlane endurance = 86.7 min"
  Source: Calculated from available energy minus hover and transition consumption
  Calculation: E_for_cruise = 718.2 × 0.80 - 106.0 - 25.0 = 443.6 Wh
               Cruise time = 443.6 / 317.9 × 60 = 83.7 min
               Total = 2 min (hover) + 1 min (transition) + 83.7 min = 86.7 min

- "QuadPlane operational radius = 100 km"
  Source: Calculated from cruise endurance × cruise velocity / 2
  Calculation: Range = 83.7 min × 40 m/s × 60 s/min / 1000 = 201 km
               Radius = 201 / 2 = 100.5 km ≈ 100 km

### Section 5.4: Matching chart methodology (@sec:comparative-results)

- "Power loading P/W = 85.64 W/N (hover constraint)"
  Source: Calculated from @eq:hover-constraint-qp
  Calculation: P/W = (1/η_hover) × sqrt(DL/(2ρ)) = (1/0.3230) × 27.68 = 85.64 W/N

- "Maximum wing loading W/S = 7.300 N/m² (stall constraint at V_min = 30 m/s)"
  Source: Calculated from @eq:wing-loading-constraint
  Calculation: W/S = 0.5 × ρ × V²_min × C_L,max = 0.5 × 0.0196 × 30² × 1.20 = 10.58 N/m²
  Note: Design point at lower W/S for margin

- "Implied wing area S = 5.083 m² for 10 kg MTOW"
  Source: Calculated from W/S
  Calculation: S = W / (W/S) = 37.11 / 7.300 = 5.083 m²

- "Implied wingspan b = 5.523 m at AR = 6"
  Source: Calculated from wing area and aspect ratio
  Calculation: b = sqrt(AR × S) = sqrt(6 × 5.083) = 5.523 m

[EXPANDED - 2025-12-28: Consolidated configuration comparison from Section 5]

NOTE: Section 6.1 now includes all configuration comparison and elimination content that
was previously distributed across Sections 5.2-5.5. This consolidation provides a single
location for the recommendation rationale.

### Configuration comparison (@tbl:config-comparison)

  Verified Data:
    - Tractor propellers operate in undisturbed air ahead of the fuselage
    - Pusher propellers experience 2–15% efficiency losses due to wake ingestion (varies with fuselage shape)
    - Contra-rotating propellers cancel reactive torque
  Note: These principles are fundamental aerospace design knowledge. The efficiency loss range 
        (2–15%) is corroborated by multiple sources including Wikipedia "Pusher configuration" 
        article which cites studies showing 12% efficiency loss for canard-pusher configurations,
        and Cambridge Aeronautics research indicating 6–16% efficiency gains for contra-rotating 
        propellers via swirl recovery.

## Section 6.5: Mass breakdown (@sec:mass-breakdown)
[NEW - 2025-12-28: Methodology moved from Section 4.11]

NOTE: Detailed weight estimation methodology was moved from Section 4.11 to Section 6.5.
This content logically belongs after constraint analysis because it requires sized geometry
(wing area, span, fuselage dimensions) which are outputs of the matching chart, not inputs.

Section 4.11 now contains only:
- Mass fraction methodology for MTOW estimation
- Reference data analysis
- MTOW baseline range (3-4 kg)

Section 6.5 now contains:
- Sadraey weight estimation equations
- Battery mass sizing (using Mars gravity g = 3.711 m/s²)
- Structural weight correlations (wing, fuselage)
- Load factor adaptation (n_ult = 3.75)
- Component mass breakdown table
- Verification against mass fractions

         helicopter rotor"
  Verified Data:
    - Full-scale helicopter (Re > 1,000,000): FM = 0.75-0.82
    - Small rotors Earth (Re 100,000-500,000): FM = 0.60-0.70

### Mars UAV load factor justification

- "Mars UAV limit load factor n_limit = 2.5, ultimate load factor n_ult = 3.75"
  Source: Design decision with methodology from [@europeanunionaviationsafetyagencyCertificationSpecificationsNormalCategory2017]
  Location: Section 4.12 load factor selection (@sec:load-factor-selection)
  Rationale:
    1. Unmanned operation - no crew injury risk, reduced consequence of failure
    2. Autonomous flight - software-limited manoeuvre envelope (typically 2-3 g max)
    3. Reduced gust loads - Mars density ~1/60 Earth, gust loads scale with ρ
    4. Precedent - Mars rotorcraft designed for low structural loads

- "Gust load factor scales with atmospheric density"
  Source: Standard gust load formulation (CS-23 Appendix A, CS-25.341)
  Location: Δn_gust ∝ ρ × U_de × V × a / (W/S)
  Verified: Mars density 0.020 kg/m³ vs Earth 1.225 kg/m³ → gust loads ~60× lower
  Note: Manoeuvring loads dominate structural design on Mars, not gust loads

- "Aerodynamic loads on the blade are small because of the low atmospheric density on Mars"
  Source: [@johnsonMarsScienceHelicopter2020]

- "Aspect ratio range AR = 10-14 for Mars UAV"
  Source: Design decision based on trade-off analysis
  Location: Section 4.12, Geometry parameter bounds
  Rationale:
    - Lower bound (10): Minimum for acceptable L/D at high C_L operating conditions
    - Upper bound (14): Maximum before structural weight penalty and chord/Re constraints dominate
  Trade-offs documented:
    - Induced drag: C_D,i = C_L²/(π×AR×e) — favours high AR
    - Wing weight: scales as AR^0.6 — favours low AR
    - Chord/Re: c = sqrt(S/AR), higher AR reduces Re — constrains upper bound

- "Wing weight scales approximately as AR^0.6"

  Source: [@sadraeyAircraftDesignSystems2013]
  Location: Chapter 5 "Wing Design", Section 5.7 "Taper Ratio" (Pages 229-232)
  Verified content:
    - λ = 0.4 closely approximates elliptical lift distribution for unswept wings
    - Rectangular wing (λ = 1.0) is aerodynamically inefficient
    - Delta wing (λ = 0) best for structural weight but causes tip stall
  Note: Based on Prandtl lifting-line theory; Schrenk method used for practical estimation

- "Taper ratio affects spanwise lift distribution"
  Source: [@sadraeyAircraftDesignSystems2013]
  Location: Chapter 5, Section 5.8 "The Significance of Lift and Load Distributions"
  Key concepts:
    - Elliptical distribution minimizes induced drag
    - λ = 0.4 closely approximates elliptical for unswept wings
    - λ = 0.5 provides ~98% of theoretical minimum induced drag

- "Nominal taper ratio λ = 0.5 adopted for baseline"
  Source: Design decision
  Location: Section 4.12, @tbl:geometry-summary

### Sweep angle (Λ = 0°)

- "Sweep angle Λ = 0° for Mars UAV"
  Source: Design decision based on low Mach number
  Location: Section 4.12, Sweep angle subsection
  Justification:
    - Mars cruise Mach M = V/a = 40/230 ≈ 0.17
    - Sweep used to delay compressibility effects at M > 0.7
    - No aerodynamic benefit at M = 0.17

- "Wing sweep delays compressibility effects at transonic speeds"
  Source: [@sadraeyAircraftDesignSystems2013]
  Location: Chapter 5, Section 5.9 "Sweep Angle" (Pages 235-240)
  Key mechanisms:
    - Sweep reduces effective Mach number normal to leading edge: M_n = M × cos(Λ)
    - Increases critical Mach number M_cr
    - Primarily beneficial for M > 0.7 flight
  Penalties of sweep:
    - Increased structural complexity (bending-torsion coupling)
    - Heavier structure
    - Reduced lift curve slope C_L,α
    - Poor stall characteristics (tip stall)

- "Mars UAV cruise Mach number M ≈ 0.17"

### Configuration Selection Rationale

- "Rotorcraft NOT RECOMMENDED despite numerically meeting requirements"
  Source: This analysis
  Location: Section 5.5, Elimination of alternatives
  Rationale:
    1. 3% endurance margin unacceptable for no-abort mission
    2. 10% density reduction eliminates margin
    3. No glide capability - crashes immediately on rotor failure
    4. (L/D)_eff ≈ 4 is physical limit

- "Fixed-wing NOT FEASIBLE - fails VTOL requirement"
  Source: This analysis
  Location: Section 5.5, Elimination of alternatives
  Rationale:
    1. Ground roll 5-6 km - no runway exists on Mars
    2. Alternative launch methods impractical for habitat operations
    3. Landing equally problematic at 90 m/s approach speed

- "Hybrid VTOL (QuadPlane) SELECTED as baseline configuration"
  Source: This analysis
  Location: Section 5.5, Recommendation
  Rationale:
    1. ONLY configuration satisfying ALL requirements simultaneously
    2. VTOL from lift rotors ✓
    3. 60 min endurance with 80% margin ✓
    4. Energy feasible with 62% margin ✓
    5. Mass penalty justified as enabling cost
    6. Degraded-mode glide capability
