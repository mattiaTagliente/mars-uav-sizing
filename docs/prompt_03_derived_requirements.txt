PROMPT 03: DERIVED REQUIREMENTS AND INITIAL WEIGHT ESTIMATE
================================================================================
Task: Create Section 3.3 (Derived Requirements) and Section 3.4 (Initial 
      Weight Estimate) with proper theoretical framework and citations
Output: 2 section files with complete analytical content

================================================================================
WORKFLOW: MANUSCRIPT FIRST, THEN CODE
================================================================================

This task follows a THREE-PHASE workflow:

PHASE 1: THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT (this prompt)
   - Develop the methodology for deriving requirements
   - Present weight fraction analysis methodology with citations
   - Establish the analytical framework for MTOW estimation
   - Complete all research and citations FIRST

PHASE 2: PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION (subsequent task)
   - Scripts read reference_drones.yaml and calculate statistics
   - Scripts implement the methodology described in the manuscript
   - No new methodology - code follows manuscript

PHASE 3: NUMERICAL RESULTS (subsequent task)
   - Run scripts to get actual weight fraction values
   - Insert calculated results into manuscript
   - Verify all numbers trace to data sources

THIS PROMPT COVERS PHASE 1 ONLY.

================================================================================
CONTEXT
================================================================================

You are working on a Mars UAV feasibility study. The document structure 
separates:
- Section 2.3 "Mission needs": Qualitative capabilities
- Section 3.3 "Derived requirements": Numerical targets, derived from analysis
- Section 3.4 "Initial weight estimate": MTOW baseline from weight fractions

IMPORTANT: "Single-fault tolerance" is a NEED (qualitative), NOT a requirement.
It belongs in Section 2.3, not here. Section 3.3 contains ONLY numerical values.

================================================================================
PROJECT PROTOCOLS (MANDATORY)
================================================================================

1. METHODOLOGY CITATION: Cite sources for requirement derivation methods
   - How do established design methodologies derive requirements?
   - Reference aircraft design textbooks (Raymer, Sadraey, Roskam)

2. WEIGHT FRACTION SOURCES: Research weight fraction methodologies
   - Statistical methods from aircraft design literature
   - Historical data approaches

3. NO HARDCODED VALUES: Present the methodology for calculating values
   - Actual numbers will come from Python analysis in Phase 2
   - Use placeholders like "[CALCULATED FROM REFERENCE DATA]"

4. TRACEABILITY: Every requirement must link to:
   - The mission need it addresses
   - The derivation methodology
   - The data source (to be calculated)
