PROMPT 02D: AERODYNAMIC COEFFICIENTS ESTIMATION
================================================================================
Task: Research and document aerodynamic coefficient estimation methods and values
Output: Manuscript content for 04_07_aerodynamic-analysis.md (C_D0, Oswald e)
        Consolidation of C_L,max from existing airfoil analysis

================================================================================
CONTEXT
================================================================================

You are working on a Mars UAV feasibility study. This task addresses the
aerodynamic coefficients needed for the constraint analysis (Section 5):

1. Maximum lift coefficient (C_L,max) - for stall constraint
2. Oswald efficiency factor (e) - for induced drag calculation
3. Zero-lift drag coefficient (C_D0) - for parasite drag calculation

These coefficients are used in:
- Drag polar: C_D = C_D0 + C_L² / (π × AR × e)
- Lift-to-drag ratio: L/D = C_L / C_D
- Stall speed: V_stall = sqrt(2W / (ρ × S × C_L,max))

OPERATING CONDITIONS:
- Reynolds number: Re ≈ 60,000 (based on chord ~0.25m, V ~40 m/s, Mars ρ/μ)
- Mach number: M ≈ 0.17 (subsonic, compressibility negligible)
- Aspect ratio range: AR = 10-14

PARAMETERS TO RESEARCH
================================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. MAXIMUM LIFT COEFFICIENT (C_L,max)

This parameter is ALREADY AVAILABLE from the airfoil selection analysis.
The task is to CONSOLIDATE and VERIFY the values.

c) Recommend design value for sizing:
   - Conservative: C_L,max = 1.0 (lower bound of candidates)
   - Nominal: C_L,max = 1.1 (average)
d) Document Reynolds number sensitivity if data available

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. OSWALD EFFICIENCY FACTOR (e)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition: The Oswald efficiency factor accounts for non-elliptical lift
distribution and additional induced drag sources. It appears in:

C_D_induced = C_L² / (π × AR × e)

SEARCH STRATEGY:

a) Primary source - Raymer "Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach":
   - Search Zotero: "Raymer aircraft design"
   - Look for Chapter 12 (Aerodynamics) or equivalent
   - Raymer provides empirical correlations for e
   
   RAYMER'S CORRELATION (to verify):
   For straight wings (Λ = 0°):
   e = 1.78 × (1 - 0.045 × AR^0.68) - 0.64
   
   Alternative simpler form:
   e ≈ 0.80 - 0.85 for well-designed straight wings

b) Secondary source - Nicolai "Fundamentals of Aircraft Design":
   - Alternative source for Oswald factor estimation
   - May have different correlation

c) Tertiary source - Anderson "Introduction to Flight":
   - Basic textbook treatment
   - Typical values cited

d) Check for low-Re specific data:
   - Search: "Oswald efficiency low Reynolds"
   - At low Re, e may degrade due to thicker boundary layers

DATA TO COLLECT:
| Field                    | Description                          | Expected   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| e_correlation            | Empirical correlation formula        | equation   |
| e_correlation_source     | Citation for correlation             | Raymer     |
| e_straight_wing_typical  | Typical e for straight, unswept wing | 0.80-0.85  |
| e_low_re_adjustment      | Adjustment for low Re (if any)       | -0.05?     |
| e_recommended            | Design value for Mars UAV            | 0.80       |
| AR_range_for_correlation | AR range where correlation is valid  | 4-16       |

MANUSCRIPT CONTENT TO DRAFT:

a) Present the Oswald factor definition:
   "The Oswald efficiency factor e accounts for the deviation from ideal
   elliptical lift distribution and other induced drag effects. Empirical
   correlations provide e as a function of wing geometry."

b) Present the correlation equation with citation:
   "For unswept wings of moderate aspect ratio, Raymer [@raymer...] provides:
   $$e = 1.78 \times (1 - 0.045 \times AR^{0.68}) - 0.64$$ {#eq:oswald-raymer}"
   
   Note: Verify this is the EXACT equation from Raymer.

c) Calculate e for AR = 10, 12, 14:
   | AR | e (Raymer) |
   |----|------------|
   | 10 | [calculate]|
   | 12 | [calculate]|
   | 14 | [calculate]|

d) Discuss low-Re effects:
   - State whether correlation is validated at low Re
   - If no low-Re data, note uncertainty
   - May apply conservative reduction (e.g., e_design = e_correlation - 0.05)

e) Recommend design value:
   e = 0.80 (conservative for low-Re operation)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. ZERO-LIFT DRAG COEFFICIENT (C_D0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition: The zero-lift drag coefficient is the drag at C_L = 0, consisting
of skin friction and form drag from all aircraft components.

ESTIMATION METHODS:

a) COMPONENT BUILDUP METHOD (preferred for accuracy):
   
   C_D0 = Σ (C_f × FF × Q × S_wet,i) / S_ref
   
   Where:
   - C_f = skin friction coefficient
   - FF = form factor (accounts for pressure drag)
   - Q = interference factor
   - S_wet,i = wetted area of component i
   - S_ref = wing reference area
   
   SOURCE: Raymer Chapter 12 "Drag"
   
b) WETTED AREA METHOD (simpler):
   
   C_D0 = C_f × (S_wet / S_ref)
   
   Where C_f is an equivalent skin friction coefficient for the whole aircraft.
   
   Typical values:
   - Clean sailplane: C_f,equiv ≈ 0.003
   - Light aircraft: C_f,equiv ≈ 0.004-0.005
   - Small UAV: C_f,equiv ≈ 0.005-0.008
   
   SOURCE: Search for wetted area drag method

c) STATISTICAL/EMPIRICAL METHOD:
   
   For similar aircraft class, C_D0 falls in a range:
   - High-performance sailplane: C_D0 ≈ 0.010-0.015
   - Light aircraft: C_D0 ≈ 0.020-0.030
   - Small UAV with fixed landing gear: C_D0 ≈ 0.025-0.040

SEARCH STRATEGY:

a) Primary source - Raymer:
   - Search Zotero: "Raymer aircraft design"
   - Look for: Skin friction coefficient (C_f) equations
   - Look for: Form factor (FF) correlations
   - Look for: Interference factors (Q)
   
   KEY EQUATIONS TO FIND:
   
   Skin friction for laminar flow:
   C_f = 1.328 / sqrt(Re_L)  [Blasius]
   
   Skin friction for turbulent flow:
   C_f = 0.455 / (log10(Re_L))^2.58  [Prandtl-Schlichting]
   
   Or Raymer's correlation:
   C_f = 0.455 / ((log10(Re))^2.58 × (1 + 0.144 × M²)^0.65)

b) Secondary source - Hoerner "Fluid Dynamic Drag":
   - Comprehensive drag data
   - May be in Zotero or online

c) LOW REYNOLDS NUMBER CONSIDERATION:
   - At Re ~ 60,000, flow is in transition region
   - May be partially laminar, partially turbulent
   - C_f higher than pure turbulent at same Re
   - Search for "skin friction low Reynolds transition"

MANUSCRIPT CONTENT TO DRAFT:

a) Present the drag polar equation with citation:
   "The aircraft drag polar is expressed as:
   $$C_D = C_{D0} + \frac{C_L^2}{\pi \cdot AR \cdot e}$$ {#eq:drag-polar}
   where $C_{D0}$ is the zero-lift drag coefficient and $e$ is the Oswald
   efficiency factor [@raymer...]."

b) Present C_D0 estimation methodology:
   - Component buildup OR equivalent skin friction method
   - State which method is used and why
   - Cite source for method

c) Calculate or estimate C_D0:
   - If using component buildup: show calculation
   - If using statistical: cite comparable aircraft

d) Low-Re considerations:
   - Discuss skin friction at Re ~ 60,000
   - Note transition effects
   - Justify chosen value

e) Recommend design value:
   C_D0 = 0.030 (or calculated value)
   
   With rationale:
   "A conservative value of $C_{D0}$ = 0.030 is adopted, accounting for
   low Reynolds number effects and fixed-rotor installation drag."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. FULL DRAG POLAR SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After determining e and C_D0, present the complete drag polar:

C_D = 0.030 + C_L² / (π × 12 × 0.80)  [for AR = 12]
C_D = 0.030 + C_L² / 30.16
C_D = 0.030 + 0.0332 × C_L²

Calculate key performance metrics:

a) Maximum L/D:
   (L/D)_max = 0.5 × sqrt(π × AR × e / C_D0)
   (L/D)_max = 0.5 × sqrt(π × 12 × 0.80 / 0.030)
   (L/D)_max ≈ [calculate]

b) C_L at (L/D)_max:
   C_L* = sqrt(π × AR × e × C_D0)
   C_L* = sqrt(30.16 × 0.030)
   C_L* ≈ [calculate]

c) Plot drag polar:
   - Generate C_D vs C_L curve
   - Mark (L/D)_max point
   - This will be a figure in 04_07
