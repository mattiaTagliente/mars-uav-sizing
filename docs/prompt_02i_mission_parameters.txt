PROMPT 02I: MISSION PARAMETERS DERIVATION
================================================================================
Task: Derive and justify mission velocity and time parameters for Mars UAV
Output: Manuscript content for 04_12_derived-requirements.md (mission section)

================================================================================
CONTEXT
================================================================================

You are working on a Mars UAV feasibility study. The constraint analysis
requires quantified mission parameters:

1. Cruise velocity (V_cruise) - drives power and Reynolds number
2. Minimum velocity (V_min) - for stall margin
3. Hover time allocation - for energy budget
4. Cruise endurance target - mission capability

These parameters must be:
- Derived from mission requirements (@sec:user-needs)
- Consistent with atmospheric conditions (@sec:operational-environment)
- Compatible with airfoil Reynolds number constraints

================================================================================
PROJECT PROTOCOLS (MANDATORY)
================================================================================

1. TRACE TO REQUIREMENTS:
   - Each parameter links to user needs or derived requirement
   - Document the derivation chain

2. PHYSICAL CONSISTENCY:
   - Check Reynolds number compatibility
   - Check Mach number limits
   - Verify power/energy feasibility

3. CITE SOURCES:
   - Methodology for optimal velocity
   - Any precedent values from Mars UAV studies

================================================================================
PARAMETERS TO DERIVE
================================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. CRUISE VELOCITY (V_cruise)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cruise velocity must satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously.

CONSTRAINT 1: REYNOLDS NUMBER COMPATIBILITY

For the airfoil analysis to be valid, the wing chord Reynolds number must
match the experimental data range:

Re = ρ × V × c / μ ≈ 60,000

Given Mars atmospheric properties at operating altitude:
- ρ = 0.020 kg/m³ (from @sec:operational-environment)
- μ = 1.1 × 10⁻⁵ Pa·s (dynamic viscosity)

The Reynolds number constraint gives:
V × c = Re × μ / ρ = 60,000 × 1.1 × 10⁻⁵ / 0.020 = 33 m²/s

For different chord lengths:
| Chord (m) | Required V (m/s) | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| 0.25 | 132 | Too fast, Mach limit |
| 0.30 | 110 | Still too fast |
| 0.40 | 82.5 | High but possible |
| 0.50 | 66 | Reasonable |
| 0.60 | 55 | Good |
| 0.80 | 41 | Good |
| 1.00 | 33 | Large chord |

For Re = 60,000 exactly with V ≈ 40 m/s → c ≈ 0.83 m

CONSTRAINT 2: MACH NUMBER LIMIT

The cruise Mach number should be low enough to avoid compressibility:

M = V / a

Where a = speed of sound on Mars:
a = sqrt(γ × R × T) ≈ sqrt(1.29 × 188 × 210) ≈ 226 m/s

At V = 40 m/s: M = 40 / 226 = 0.18 (acceptable, well below critical Mach)

CONSTRAINT 3: OPTIMAL CRUISE FOR ENDURANCE

For battery-electric aircraft, maximum endurance occurs at maximum L/D.
However, for maximum RANGE, the optimal speed is different.

For maximum range (mission objective):
V_max_range = sqrt(2W / (ρ × S × C_L*))

Where C_L* is the lift coefficient for minimum drag.

RESEARCH:
- Find optimal cruise speed methodology for electric aircraft
- Source: Raymer or Anderson
- Compare endurance-optimal vs range-optimal speeds

CONSTRAINT 4: OPERATIONAL RADIUS

Mission requirement: 50 km operational radius (100 km round trip)
Target cruise time: reasonable fraction of total endurance

At V = 40 m/s:
- Round trip distance: 100 km
- Cruise time: 100,000 / 40 = 2500 s ≈ 42 minutes
- With reserves and loiter: ~60 minutes total cruise

RECOMMENDED VALUE:
V_cruise = 40 m/s (with sensitivity range 35-45 m/s)

RATIONALE:
- Re ≈ 60,000 with chord ≈ 0.8 m
- M ≈ 0.18 (well subsonic)
- Achieves 50 km radius in ~21 minutes each way

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. MINIMUM VELOCITY (V_min)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The minimum velocity defines the stall margin for safe flight.

STALL SPEED:
V_stall = sqrt(2W / (ρ × S × C_L,max))

The stall speed depends on wing loading (W/S) which is a constraint analysis
output. However, we can estimate bounds:

Example calculation:
- MTOW = 4 kg → W = 4 × 3.711 = 14.8 N
- Wing area S = 0.15 m² (estimate)
- W/S = 14.8 / 0.15 = 99 N/m² = 99 Pa
- ρ = 0.020 kg/m³
- C_L,max = 1.0 (from airfoil)

V_stall = sqrt(2 × 99 / (0.020 × 1.0)) = sqrt(9900) = 99.5 m/s

This is HIGHER than cruise velocity! This indicates:
- Either wing area must be larger
- Or W/S must be lower
- This is exactly what the constraint analysis will determine

STALL MARGIN:
V_min ≥ 1.2 × V_stall (20% margin typical)
Or V_min ≥ 1.3 × V_stall (30% margin for safety-critical)

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
- Do NOT fix V_min numerically
- Express as constraint: V_min ≥ 1.2 × V_stall
- Let constraint analysis determine compatible W/S

For initial sizing, assume:
V_min ≈ 0.4 × V_cruise = 0.4 × 40 = 16 m/s (placeholder)

This will be refined when W/S is determined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. HOVER TIME ALLOCATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For hybrid VTOL, hover time is limited to takeoff, landing, and contingency.

TAKEOFF PHASE:
- Vertical climb to safe altitude: 20-30 m
- Climb rate assumption: 1-2 m/s
- Transition to forward flight: 10-20 seconds
- Total takeoff hover: 30-60 seconds

LANDING PHASE:
- Transition from forward flight: 10-20 seconds
- Vertical descent and touchdown: 20-30 seconds
- Total landing hover: 30-60 seconds

CONTINGENCY:
- Unexpected hover (abort, obstacle): 30-60 seconds
- Wind hover for precision landing: 30 seconds
- Total contingency: 30-60 seconds

TOTAL HOVER TIME:
t_hover = t_takeoff + t_landing + t_contingency
t_hover = 60 + 60 + 60 = 180 seconds (conservative)
t_hover = 30 + 30 + 30 = 90 seconds (optimistic)

RECOMMENDED VALUE:
t_hover = 120-180 seconds (2-3 minutes total)

For energy calculations, use t_hover = 180 s (conservative)

INGENUITY REFERENCE:
- Search for Ingenuity hover times
- Typical flight: 90-120 seconds total
- But Ingenuity is pure rotorcraft, all flight is "hover"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. CRUISE ENDURANCE TARGET
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cruise endurance must satisfy the operational radius requirement.

MISSION REQUIREMENT:
- Operational radius: 50 km (from @sec:user-needs)
- Cruise velocity: 40 m/s

MINIMUM CRUISE TIME:
- Outbound: 50,000 / 40 = 1250 s = 20.8 min
- Return: 50,000 / 40 = 1250 s = 20.8 min
- Total cruise: 2500 s = 41.7 min

MARGINS:
- Headwind margin: 20% (winds up to ~10 m/s)
- Loiter time for survey: 10-15 min at target area
- Navigation margin: 10%

CALCULATION:
- Basic cruise: 42 min
- Headwind: +8 min
- Loiter: +10 min
- Navigation: +4 min
- Total: 64 min

RECOMMENDED VALUE:
t_cruise = 60-90 minutes (target: 75 min nominal)

ENERGY RESERVE:
In addition to cruise time, 20% energy reserve is maintained.

Total flight time budget:
t_total = t_hover + t_cruise + reserve
t_total = 3 + 75 + (implied in battery sizing) = 78 min flight + reserve

### Mission velocity and time parameters {#sec:mission-parameters}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Cruise velocity

The cruise velocity is selected based on multiple constraints:

1. **Reynolds number compatibility**: The wing chord Reynolds number should
   match the experimental airfoil data at Re ≈ 60,000. With Mars atmospheric
   viscosity and density, this constraint gives:
   
   $$V \times c = \frac{Re \times \mu}{\rho} ≈ 33 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}$$
   
   For a chord of approximately 0.8 m, the required velocity is ~40 m/s.

2. **Mach number limit**: At V = 40 m/s and Mars speed of sound a ≈ 226 m/s,
   the cruise Mach number is M ≈ 0.18, well below the critical Mach number.

3. **Mission requirement**: The 50 km operational radius requires approximately
   42 minutes of cruise time at 40 m/s (round trip).

The cruise velocity is therefore:

$$V_{cruise} = 40 \text{ m/s}$$ {#eq:cruise-velocity}

with a sensitivity range of 35-45 m/s for constraint analysis.

#### Minimum velocity

The minimum operating velocity provides a margin above stall:

$$V_{min} \geq 1.2 \times V_{stall}$$ {#eq:v-min}

where the stall speed is determined by the wing loading constraint
(@sec:constraint-analysis). The factor 1.2 provides a 20% safety margin,
consistent with standard practice [@raymer...].

#### Hover time allocation

For the hybrid VTOL configuration, hover time is limited to vertical takeoff,
landing, and contingency operations:

| Phase | Duration (s) |
|-------|-------------|
| Takeoff (climb + transition) | 60 |
| Landing (transition + descent) | 60 |
| Contingency reserve | 60 |
| **Total hover** | **180** |

: Hover time allocation {#tbl:hover-allocation}

The total hover time of 180 seconds (3 minutes) is used for energy calculations.

#### Cruise endurance

The cruise endurance requirement is derived from the 50 km operational radius:

$$t_{cruise} = \frac{2 \times R_{op}}{V_{cruise}} + t_{loiter} + t_{margin}$$

With 15 minutes of loiter time and 20% margin:

$$t_{cruise} = \frac{2 \times 50,000}{40} + 15 \times 60 + 0.2 \times t_{cruise}$$

Solving: $t_{cruise}$ ≈ 75 minutes (nominal)

The target cruise endurance is:

$$t_{cruise} = 60-90 \text{ min}$$ {#eq:cruise-endurance}

#### Mission profile

@tbl:mission-profile summarizes the complete mission timeline.

| Phase | Duration | Cumulative |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Takeoff hover | 1 min | 1 min |
| Outbound cruise | 21 min | 22 min |
| Survey operations | 15 min | 37 min |
| Return cruise | 21 min | 58 min |
| Landing hover | 1 min | 59 min |
| Contingency | 1 min | 60 min |

: Nominal mission profile {#tbl:mission-profile}

A 20% energy reserve is maintained in addition to the above timeline.
