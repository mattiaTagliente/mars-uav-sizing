PROMPT 02: CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS BY CONFIGURATION
================================================================================
Task: Draft Section 6 - quantitative comparison of rotorcraft, fixed-wing, 
      and hybrid VTOL configurations using matching chart analysis
Output: 6 section files (06_00 through 06_05) with complete analytical framework

================================================================================
WORKFLOW: MANUSCRIPT FIRST, THEN CODE
================================================================================

This task follows a THREE-PHASE workflow:

PHASE 1: THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT (this prompt)
   - Research and cite all equations from authoritative sources
   - Present the analytical models with proper derivations
   - Follow the citation protocol strictly
   - Build the complete conceptual framework in the manuscript

PHASE 2: PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION (subsequent task)
   - Develop scripts that EXACTLY reproduce the cited equations
   - No new equations - only implement what's in the manuscript
   - Scripts are a computational tool, not a source of equations

PHASE 3: NUMERICAL RESULTS (subsequent task)
   - Run scripts with verified input parameters
   - Add numerical results to manuscript
   - Generate figures for inclusion

THIS PROMPT COVERS PHASE 1 ONLY.

================================================================================
CONTEXT
================================================================================

You are working on a Mars UAV feasibility study. This section provides the
QUANTITATIVE JUSTIFICATION for selecting the hybrid VTOL (QuadPlane) 
configuration over pure rotorcraft or pure fixed-wing alternatives.

The key insight is that the Mars atmosphere (~1/60 of Earth sea level density)
imposes severe constraints on all configurations, but affects them differently:
- Rotorcraft: hover power scales as 1/sqrt(rho), limiting endurance
- Fixed-wing: no runway on Mars, cannot take off conventionally  
- Hybrid VTOL: pays mass penalty for dual systems but achieves feasibility

================================================================================
PROJECT PROTOCOLS (MANDATORY)
================================================================================

1. EQUATION SOURCING: Every equation MUST be cited
   - Search Zotero Mars_UAV collection first
   - If not found, search full Zotero library
   - If not found, search web for authoritative sources
   - Add new sources to Zotero before citing
   - Verify citation key exists in Mars_UAV.bib

2. PARAMETER VALUES: Every numerical value MUST be traced
   - State the source for each parameter
   - Map to source_grounding.txt

3. DERIVATIONS: Show complete derivation chains
   - Start from fundamental principles
   - Each step must be justified

4. NO UNVERIFIED CLAIMS: If source cannot be found, state "further research needed"
