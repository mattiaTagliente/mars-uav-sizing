Analysis of Matching Charts Methodology

i) Difference between "Optimization Variables (Solved)" and "Outputs (Results)"

This is an important conceptual distinction:

Optimization Variables (Solved) are the unknowns that the solver (fsolve) iteratively adjusts to satisfy the system of 5 constraint equations. These are the variables we seek as part of the optimization problem:

Variable  Symbol  Description
W         Total weight    The aircraft gross weight
S_W       Wing loading    W/S ratio
T_S       Thrust loading  T/S ratio
lam       Aspect ratio    Bounded [6, 12]
k         Fuel fraction   Wf/W

In the MATLAB script (lines 8-12), these are defined as optimvar() objects that the solver manipulates.

Outputs (Results) are derived quantities calculated from the solved optimization variables AFTER convergence. These are not unknowns—they are post-processing computations:

Output           Formula             Description
S                S = W × S_W         Wing area
b                b = √(S × λ)        Wingspan
c                (MAC formula)       Mean aerodynamic chord
T                T = T_S × S         Total thrust
Cl, Cd, L/D      (aerodynamic calcs) Cruise aerodynamics

The distinction is:
Optimization variables: Inputs to the solver, iterated to find solution
Outputs: Computed from the solution, reported for downstream design

ii) Reynolds Number: Calculation, Output, or Hypothesis?

Examining the MATLAB script (lines 69, 175):

% Line 69 (before solver):
Rewing = V*c/nu;

% Line 175 (after solver):
Rewing = V*c/nu;

The Reynolds number is an OUTPUT, computed from other parameters and the solved MAC (c).
The calculation chain is:
1. V (cruise velocity) = 221.2 m/s → INPUT (hypothesis/fixed constant)
2. nu (kinematic viscosity) = 2.44×10⁻⁵ m²/s → INPUT (atmosphere property)
3. c (MAC) → OUTPUT (computed from solved S, λ, and taper ratio)
4. Re = V × c / nu → OUTPUT (computed from 1, 2, 3)

So, for the regional jet:
- Re is neither a hypothesis nor an input
- Re is a derived output from wing geometry that emerges from the sizing solution

This is important for airfoil selection: The sizing script must be run FIRST to obtain the wing geometry (S, b, c), and THEN the Reynolds number can be calculated to feed into XFOIL for airfoil analysis. This is the correct workflow sequence as you remember.

OPTIMIZATION VARIABLES (Unknowns to be Solved)

Variable    Mars UAV          Regional Jet       Difference
W           Total weight      Total weight       ✅ Same concept
W/S         Wing loading      Wing loading       ✅ Same concept
λ           Aspect ratio      Aspect ratio       ✅ Same concept
P/W ⚠️      Power loading     T/S (thrust loading) CHANGED to power-based
$f_{batt}$ ⚠️ Battery fraction k (fuel fraction)  CHANGED semantics (mass constant)

Key differences:
T/S → P/W: For electric propulsion, power loading (W/N or W/kg) is more natural than thrust loading because we size by power consumption, not thrust production.
k → $f_{batt}$: Fuel fraction diminishes during flight (Breguet); battery fraction is constant. The energy equation changes fundamentally.

Workflow Implication

Based on the document_reorganization_plan.txt, the Reynolds number feeds into aerodynamic analysis (Section 5) which precedes constraint analysis (Section 6). This means:

Phase 1: Assume initial MTOW and wing loading → estimate MAC → estimate Re → select airfoil (Section 5)
Phase 2: Use airfoil $C_L$, $C_D$ data at estimated Re → run matching chart (Section 6)
Iterate: If sizing result changes Re significantly (>10%), re-run airfoil analysis

This is consistent with the iterative methodology described in Section 4.1 of your plan.
