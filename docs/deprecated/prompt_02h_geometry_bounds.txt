PROMPT 02H: GEOMETRY BOUNDS AND RATIONALE
================================================================================
Task: Research and justify geometry parameter bounds for Mars UAV design
Output: Manuscript content for 04_12_derived-requirements.md (geometry section)

================================================================================
CONTEXT
================================================================================

You are working on a Mars UAV feasibility study. The constraint analysis
requires bounds on key geometry parameters:

1. Aspect ratio (AR) - affects induced drag and structural weight
2. Thickness ratio (t/c) - from airfoil selection, affects waves and structure
3. Taper ratio (λ) - affects lift distribution and structural weight
4. Sweep angle (Λ) - affects compressibility (not relevant at Mars Mach)

These parameters define the wing planform and are inputs to:
- Drag polar calculation (AR, e dependency)
- Weight estimation (AR, t/c, λ in weight equations)
- Stall speed calculation (via C_L,max and wing area)

================================================================================
PROJECT PROTOCOLS (MANDATORY)
================================================================================

1. EVERY BOUND MUST BE JUSTIFIED:
   - Cite source for recommended ranges
   - Explain trade-offs that define the bounds
   - Document any Mars-specific considerations

2. SEARCH ZOTERO FIRST:
   - Look for aircraft design textbooks (Raymer, Roskam, Nicolai)
   - Look for UAV design references
   - Look for Mars UAV studies

3. CROSS-REFERENCE WITH EXISTING DATA:
   - Check commercial VTOL reference data for actual values
   - Check Mars UAV concepts for design choices
   - Validate bounds against real designs

================================================================================
PARAMETERS TO RESEARCH
================================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ASPECT RATIO (AR) - [10, 14]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition: AR = b² / S = b / c_mean

Where:
- b = wingspan (m)
- S = wing area (m²)
- c_mean = mean chord (m)

TRADE-OFFS:

a) INDUCED DRAG (favors HIGH AR):
   C_D,induced = C_L² / (π × AR × e)
   
   Higher AR → lower induced drag → higher L/D → better efficiency
   At Mars low density, lift coefficient is high → induced drag dominates
   
   RESEARCH: Optimal AR for maximum L/D at given C_D0 and e

b) STRUCTURAL WEIGHT (favors LOW AR):
   Wing weight ∝ AR^β (typical β ≈ 0.5-0.7)
   Higher AR → longer span → higher bending moment → heavier spar
   
   RESEARCH: AR exponent in Sadraey/Raymer weight equations

c) REYNOLDS NUMBER (favors MODERATE AR):
   For fixed wing area: c = S / b = S / sqrt(AR × S) = sqrt(S / AR)
   Higher AR → smaller chord → lower Reynolds number
   At very low Re, airfoil performance degrades
   
   Constraint: Re = ρVc/μ ≥ 50,000 (for good airfoil performance)

d) STRUCTURAL STIFFNESS (favors LOW AR):
   Higher AR → more flexible wing → flutter concerns
   For small UAVs, this is less critical

BOUNDS SELECTION:

| Bound | Value | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Lower | AR = 10 | Minimum for good L/D at high C_L |
| Upper | AR = 14 | Maximum before structural penalty dominates |

SOURCES TO FIND:
- Raymer: AR optimization charts or equations
- Mars UAV studies: What AR values are used?
- Ingenuity: AR of blades (for reference)
- ARES: AR value from publications

COMMERCIAL VTOL REFERENCE:
Extract AR from reference_drones.yaml:
- Calculate AR = wingspan² / wing_area for each UAV
- Or AR = wingspan / chord if chord available
- Report range for validation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. THICKNESS RATIO (t/c) - [0.08, 0.12]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition: t/c = maximum_thickness / chord

This parameter comes from airfoil selection and affects:
- Structural height (spar depth)
- Wave drag (negligible at low Mach)
- Maximum lift coefficient

VALUES FROM AIRFOIL ANALYSIS:

| Airfoil | t/c | Source |
|---------|-----|--------|
| E387 | 0.091 | Selig Vol. 1 |
| S7055 | 0.10 | Selig Vol. 1 |
| SD8000 | 0.10 | Selig Vol. 1 |
| SD7037 | 0.10 | Selig Vol. 1 |
| AG455ct | 0.12 | Selig Vol. 5 |
| AG35-r | ~0.10 | Selig Vol. 5 |
| AG12 | ~0.08 | Selig Vol. 5 |

TRADE-OFFS:

a) STRUCTURAL WEIGHT (favors HIGH t/c):
   Wing weight ∝ (t/c)^(-0.3) in Raymer equation
   Thicker airfoil → deeper spar → stiffer, lighter structure
   
b) PROFILE DRAG (favors LOW t/c):
   Thicker airfoil → more form drag → lower L/D
   At low Re, this effect is moderated by transition behavior

c) MAXIMUM LIFT (varies):
   At low Re, thin airfoils may have better C_L,max
   But some thickness needed for structural practicality

BOUNDS SELECTION:

| Bound | Value | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Lower | t/c = 0.08 | Minimum for structural practicality |
| Upper | t/c = 0.12 | Maximum from candidate airfoils |

DOCUMENT:
- Source for structural weight dependency on t/c
- Confirm t/c values from airfoil analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. TAPER RATIO (λ) - [0.4, 0.6]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition: λ = c_tip / c_root

Where:
- c_tip = chord at wing tip
- c_root = chord at wing root

TRADE-OFFS:

a) LIFT DISTRIBUTION (favors λ ≈ 0.4-0.5):
   For elliptical (minimum induced drag) lift distribution:
   λ_optimal ≈ 0.4 (for unswept wings)
   
   RESEARCH: Schrenk method or Prandtl lifting line theory
   Source: Anderson "Fundamentals of Aerodynamics" or Raymer

b) STRUCTURAL WEIGHT (favors LOW λ):
   Low taper → larger root chord → deeper spar at root
   Low taper → more material near root → efficient structure
   But very low λ → tip stall tendency

c) TIP STALL (favors HIGH λ):
   Low taper → spanwise flow toward tip → tip stall first
   For safety, want root to stall before tip
   Geometric washout can mitigate this

d) MANUFACTURING (favors HIGH λ):
   λ = 1.0 (rectangular) is easiest to build
   Tapered wing requires more complex molds

SOURCES TO FIND:
- Optimal taper for minimum induced drag (theory)
- Raymer or Roskam recommended ranges
- Commercial UAV typical values

COMMERCIAL VTOL REFERENCE:
From reference_drones.yaml or manufacturer specs:
- What taper ratios do commercial VTOLs use?
- Note: many use rectangular wings (λ = 1.0) for simplicity

BOUNDS SELECTION:

| Bound | Value | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Lower | λ = 0.4 | Near optimal for minimum induced drag |
| Upper | λ = 0.6 | Compromise toward structural simplicity |

RECOMMENDED: λ = 0.5 (compromise value)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. SWEEP ANGLE (Λ) - [0°]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition: Λ = angle of quarter-chord line relative to perpendicular to fuselage

For Mars UAV: Λ = 0° (no sweep)

JUSTIFICATION:

a) MACH NUMBER:
   Mars UAV cruise Mach: M = V / a ≈ 40 / 230 ≈ 0.17
   Sweep is used to delay compressibility effects (M > 0.7)
   At M = 0.17, compressibility is completely negligible
   
   Source: Anderson "Fundamentals of Aerodynamics" - sweep chapter

b) REYNOLDS NUMBER:
   Sweep increases effective chord for pressure distribution
   But does NOT increase chord-based Reynolds number
   No benefit for low-Re performance

c) STRUCTURAL WEIGHT:
   Sweep increases bending-torsion coupling
   Sweep complicates structural design
   Adds weight without benefit at low Mach

d) STALL CHARACTERISTICS:
   Swept wings have poor stall characteristics (tip stall)
   Unswept wing has more benign stall behavior

CONCLUSION:
Λ = 0° is the only sensible choice for Mars UAV

DOCUMENT:
- Source stating sweep is for transonic/supersonic
- Confirm Mars Mach number is well below critical Mach

### Geometry parameter bounds {#sec:geometry-bounds}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section defines the geometry parameters used in the constraint analysis
and weight estimation.

#### Aspect ratio

The aspect ratio is bounded as:

$$AR \in [10, 14]$$

**Lower bound (AR = 10):** Minimum value for acceptable lift-to-drag ratio at
the high lift coefficients required in Mars conditions.

**Upper bound (AR = 14):** Maximum value before structural weight penalty
dominates. Wing weight scales approximately as $AR^{0.6}$ [@raymer...], and
higher aspect ratio also reduces chord, pushing Reynolds number toward the
lower acceptable limit.

Commercial VTOL UAVs in the reference database exhibit aspect ratios of
[X] to [X], with median [X] (@sec:commercial-vtol).

#### Thickness ratio

The thickness ratio is determined by the airfoil selection:

$$t/c \in [0.08, 0.12]$$

Candidate airfoils from @sec:aerodynamic-analysis have thickness ratios of
0.08-0.12 (@tbl:airfoil-thickness). This range provides adequate structural
depth while maintaining good low-Reynolds aerodynamic performance.

| Airfoil | t/c |
|---------|-----|
| E387 | 0.091 |
| S7055 | 0.10 |
| SD8000 | 0.10 |
| AG12 | ~0.08 |

: Candidate airfoil thickness ratios {#tbl:airfoil-thickness}

#### Taper ratio

The taper ratio is constrained to:

$$\lambda \in [0.4, 0.6]$$

A taper ratio of approximately 0.4 minimizes induced drag by approaching
elliptical lift distribution [@anderson...]. The upper bound of 0.6 represents
a compromise toward manufacturing simplicity. A nominal value of $\lambda = 0.5$
is adopted for baseline sizing.

#### Sweep angle

The quarter-chord sweep angle is:

$$\Lambda = 0°$$

Wing sweep is used to delay compressibility effects at transonic speeds.
At the Mars UAV cruise Mach number of $M ≈ 0.17$, compressibility is negligible,
and sweep provides no aerodynamic benefit [@anderson...]. An unswept wing is
structurally simpler and has better stall characteristics.

#### Geometry summary

@tbl:geometry-summary consolidates the geometry parameters for constraint analysis.

| Parameter | Symbol | Value/Range | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Aspect ratio | AR | 10-14 | L/D vs. structure trade-off |
| Thickness ratio | t/c | 0.08-0.12 | Airfoil selection |
| Taper ratio | λ | 0.4-0.6 | Near-elliptical loading |
| Sweep angle | Λ | 0° | Low Mach, no benefit |
