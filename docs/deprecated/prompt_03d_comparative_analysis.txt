SECTION 1: CONFIGURATION COMPARISON OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 REQUIREMENTS RECAP

From @sec:user-needs and @sec:derived-requirements, the Mars UAV must satisfy:

| Requirement | Threshold | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Operational radius | 50 km | Habitat exploration range |
| Cruise endurance | 60-90 min | Round trip + operations |
| VTOL capability | Required | No runway on Mars |
| Payload capacity | ≥0.5 kg | Camera + radio relay |
| Single-fault tolerance | Required | Mission-critical system |

1.2 ANALYSIS SUMMARY

Each configuration was analyzed against these requirements:

| Configuration | Method | Key Finding |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Rotorcraft | Momentum theory + (L/D)_eff | Endurance insufficient |
| Fixed-wing | Drag polar + ground roll | VTOL impossible |
| Hybrid VTOL | Combined + energy budget | All requirements met |

| Rotorcraft | [FROM §5.2] min | 60-90 min | ... |
| Fixed-wing | [FROM §5.3] min | 60-90 min | ... |
| Hybrid VTOL | [FROM §5.4] min | 60-90 min | ... |

SECTION 4: MATCHING CHART METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 INTRODUCTION TO MATCHING CHARTS

The matching chart (also called constraint diagram or P/W-W/S diagram) is a
graphical tool for aircraft preliminary sizing that shows:
- All design constraints as boundaries
- The feasible design space as the intersection of acceptable regions
- The optimal design point

CITE: Raymer "Aircraft Design" Chapter 5, or Roskam "Airplane Design" Part I,
or Sadraey "Aircraft Design" Chapter on preliminary sizing

4.2 AXES DEFINITION

X-AXIS: Wing Loading (W/S)
- Units: N/m² or Pa
- W = weight (N)
- S = wing reference area (m²)

Higher W/S means:
- Smaller wing for given weight
- Higher cruise speed
- Higher stall speed
- Lighter structure (smaller wing)

Y-AXIS: Power Loading (P/W)
- Units: W/N or W/kg (if using mass)
- P = installed power (W)
- W = weight (N)

Higher P/W means:
- More power available
- Better climb performance
- Better hover performance
- Heavier, more expensive propulsion

4.3 CONSTRAINT REPRESENTATION

Each constraint divides the chart into feasible and infeasible regions:

HOVER CONSTRAINT:
$$\left(\frac{P}{W}\right)_{hover} \geq \frac{1}{FM \times \eta} \times \sqrt{\frac{DL}{2\rho}}$$

- HORIZONTAL LINE (for fixed disk loading)
- Region ABOVE the line is feasible

CRUISE CONSTRAINT:
$$\left(\frac{P}{W}\right)_{cruise} \geq \frac{V}{(L/D) \times \eta}$$

- CURVE (L/D depends on C_L, which depends on W/S)
- Lower P/W at optimal W/S, higher at extremes
- Region ABOVE the curve is feasible

STALL CONSTRAINT:
$$\frac{W}{S} \leq \frac{1}{2} \rho V_{min}^2 C_{L,max}$$

- VERTICAL LINE at maximum W/S
- Region LEFT of the line is feasible

CLIMB CONSTRAINT (if included):
$$\left(\frac{P}{W}\right)_{climb} \geq \frac{V_{climb}}{(L/D)_{climb} \times \eta} + \frac{ROC}{V_{climb}}$$

- CURVE similar to cruise
- Region ABOVE the curve is feasible

ENERGY CONSTRAINT (for electric):
- More complex, couples P/W with mission time
- Can be shown as a boundary or checked separately

4.4 FEASIBLE REGION

The feasible design space is the INTERSECTION of all acceptable regions:
- Above hover constraint
- Above cruise constraint
- Left of stall constraint
- Satisfying energy constraint

This region represents all (W/S, P/W) combinations that satisfy all requirements.

4.5 DESIGN POINT SELECTION

The optimal design point is typically:
- MINIMUM P/W (lightest, cheapest propulsion)
- At a feasible W/S (within structural/manufacturing limits)

Often the design point is at the intersection of two or more constraints.

CITE: Raymer or equivalent for design point selection rationale

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5: MATCHING CHARTS BY CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1 ROTORCRAFT MATCHING CHART

For pure rotorcraft, the matching chart shows:
- Hover constraint: DOMINANT (very high P/W required)
- No wing, so W/S concept is replaced by disk loading
- Alternative axes: P/W vs DL (disk loading)

KEY OBSERVATION: .

[FIGURE PLACEHOLDER: matching_chart_rotorcraft.png]

5.2 FIXED-WING MATCHING CHART

For pure fixed-wing:
- Cruise constraint: defines minimum P/W
- Stall constraint: defines maximum W/S
- Feasible region exists

BUT: No point in the feasible region allows VTOL.

[FIGURE PLACEHOLDER: matching_chart_fixed_wing.png]

5.3 HYBRID VTOL MATCHING CHART

For QuadPlane:
- Hover constraint: sets minimum P/W (horizontal)
- Cruise constraint: typically below hover (not limiting)
- Stall constraint: sets maximum W/S

Feasible region:
- ABOVE hover constraint
- LEFT of stall constraint
- Energy constraint also satisfied

[FIGURE PLACEHOLDER: matching_chart_hybrid_vtol.png]

5.4 OVERLAY COMPARISON

An overlay of all three configurations shows:
- Rotorcraft: small or nonexistent feasible region
- Fixed-wing: feasible region but fails VTOL requirement
- Hybrid VTOL: feasible region satisfies all requirements

[FIGURE PLACEHOLDER: matching_chart_comparison.png]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6: DESIGN POINT DETERMINATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 HYBRID VTOL DESIGN POINT

From the matching chart analysis, the design point for the QuadPlane is:

| Parameter | Value | Constraint |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| W/S | [TO BE CALCULATED] N/m² | Near stall limit |
| P/W | [TO BE CALCULATED] W/kg | At hover constraint |

6.2 IMPLIED DESIGN PARAMETERS

From the design point:

| Derived Parameter | Value | Calculation |
|-------------------|-------|-------------|
| Wing area | S = W / (W/S) = [X] m² | From W/S and MTOW |
| Wingspan | b = √(AR × S) = [X] m | From AR and S |
| Chord | c = S / b = [X] m | Mean chord |
| Installed power | P = (P/W) × W = [X] W | From P/W and MTOW |

These values feed into the design decisions in Section 6.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 7: CONFIGURATION SELECTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.1 ELIMINATION OF ALTERNATIVES

**Rotorcraft (§5.2)**: ELIMINATED
- Reason: 
- Root cause: 
- No feasible improvement path

**Fixed-Wing (§5.3)**: 
- Reason: Cannot achieve VTOL without runway
- Root cause: Mars lacks infrastructure
- Alternative launch methods impractical

7.2 SELECTION OF HYBRID VTOL

**Hybrid VTOL (§5.4)**: 
- Meets endurance: ~[X] min ≥ 60 min requirement ✓
- Meets range: ~[X] km ≥ 100 km round trip ✓
- Meets VTOL: Lift rotors enable vertical takeoff and landing ✓
- Mass penalty: ~ %, acceptable for enabling mission

7.3 RECOMMENDATION

Based on the quantitative analysis presented in Sections 5.2 through 5.4,
the **hybrid VTOL (QuadPlane) configuration** is selected as the baseline
for the Mars UAV design.

This configuration is the **ONLY architecture** that satisfies all mission
constraints simultaneously:
- VTOL capability (critical for Mars operations)
- 60-90 minute cruise endurance (operational radius requirement)
- Energy feasibility within battery technology limits

The detailed architecture decisions are presented in @sec:design-decisions.
