## Purpose and scope

This plan defines the minimum set of actions required to produce a mission-driven and internally consistent feasibility study using the baseline-case methodology (fixed reference MTOW) and to document a deferred, improved methodology as future work.

The target outcome is a manuscript that:

* reports results that are reproducible from the current sizing code
* states feasibility conditions and limitations explicitly (payload and energy constraints included)
* avoids presenting exploratory coupled sizing results as final design results

The goal is an architecture trade study based on constraint diagrams, requiring **configuration-specific constraint diagrams**:

* **Rotorcraft**: The natural constraint plot is P/W vs DL (disk loading), not P/W vs W/S. ✓ *Already implemented in code and figures.*
* **Fixed-wing**: Classic P/W vs W/S (cruise, stall, takeoff/landing as needed). ✓ *Already implemented.*
* **Hybrid VTOL**: P/W vs W/S with hover line + cruise curve + stall line. ✓ *Already implemented.*

The uncoupled approach is acceptable for a baseline trade study (matching charts are often done "weight-free" in terms of P/W and W/S), but endurance margins must be stated as conditional on the assumed battery fraction and MTOW.

Baseline trade study approach: keep MTOW fixed (10 kg) and compare endurance/range. Call this the **"baseline case"**, not a "sized design".


## Key decisions (record)

* Baseline case is retained for this feasibility study: the comparative analysis is performed at a fixed reference MTOW justified in Section 4.
* Mission constraints are treated as non-negotiable requirements, including payload mass and endurance.
* Energy feasibility is treated as necessary for any configuration labelled feasible, including reserve and non-cruise phases.
* A configuration-specific coupled sizing workflow (improved approach) is deferred to future work and is not required for feasibility-study completion.

## Working definition of “feasible” (necessary and sufficient for this study)

For a configuration to be labelled feasible in the baseline case, all items below must be satisfied simultaneously under the same set of assumptions:

* Payload: the mission payload mass is carried as a fixed mass term in the mass model, and the baseline MTOW allocation remains consistent with the assumed mass fractions in Section 4.
* VTOL: configurations that do not satisfy the VTOL requirement are labelled not feasible regardless of endurance.
* Energy: the mission energy budget including hover, transition allowance, cruise, battery depth of discharge, discharge efficiency, and reserve fraction is satisfied.
* Endurance and range: the computed mission endurance and range satisfy the requirement thresholds.

If a condition is not modelled (for example, packaging volume, thermal margins, controllability, actuator sizing), it must be stated as an unverified item

## Current state audit (inputs and code authority)

  - The manuscript’s matching-chart section is explicitly a single baseline case at MTOW = 10.00 kg (see
    sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md:135). That’s why it can turn the chart into
    absolute numbers like S = 2.574 m², P_hover = 3181 W, etc. It’s a scenario, not a closed-loop “size-to-requirement”
    result.
  - The “uncoupled” code (src/mars_uav_sizing/) mirrors that: it uses one global MTOW (mission.mass.mtow_kg) and one
    global battery fraction (mission.mass_fractions.f_battery) for all three configurations. So the comparisons are
    “given the same 10 kg vehicle with the same battery fraction, what endurance/range do the three architectures
    produce?”
  - **Configuration-specific matching charts exist** (verified 2025-12-30):
    - `plot_rotorcraft_matching_chart()` uses P/W vs DL axes correctly
    - `plot_fixed_wing_matching_chart()` uses P/W vs W/S axes
    - `plot_matching_chart()` (hybrid VTOL) uses P/W vs W/S with hover/cruise/stall constraints
  - The configurations share global assumptions (MTOW, battery fraction, disk loading, speeds) but use
    configuration-appropriate constraint spaces in their respective figures.”

* Manuscript results in Section 5.4 are expressed for a baseline `MTOW = 10.00 kg` and use that MTOW to compute absolute geometry and installed power (`S`, `b`, `P`), see `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md`.
* Uncoupled code path (authoritative for baseline case): `src/mars_uav_sizing/`.
* Coupled code path (exploratory, not yet suitable for baseline-case manuscript numbers): `src/mars_uav_sizing_coupled/` currently solves one coupled state and reuses it across configurations, which is not a mission-fair comparison across architectures.

## Deliverables

* Updated manuscript sections that match the uncoupled code outputs and state feasibility conditions precisely
* Reproducible baseline report generated from `src/mars_uav_sizing/run_analysis.py` and stored under `reports/` with an unambiguous label and UTF-8-safe output.
* A future-work subsection describing the deferred “improved approach” without changing the current feasibility-study scope.

## Action steps (baseline case completion)

### 1. Align definitions, assumptions, and terminology in the manuscript

**Objective:** Ensure the manuscript clearly communicates that this is a baseline scenario study, not a closed-loop sizing result.

* Add a short paragraph in `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md` stating explicitly that the matching-chart design point is evaluated at a fixed baseline MTOW (reference case), and that it is not a closed-loop sizing result.
* Add a short paragraph in `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md` stating that the energy constraint is verified by an explicit mission energy budget evaluation at the candidate design point, and is not plotted as a separate constraint line for the fixed disk loading baseline case.
* Add a short paragraph in `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md` stating what is held constant across configurations in the baseline comparison (payload mass, MTOW, battery technology assumptions, reserve policy, mission time allocations).

**Practical steps:**

1. Open `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md`
2. After the "Matching chart fundamentals" subsection (around line 76), insert a new subsection:
   ```markdown
   ### Baseline case definition {#sec:baseline-case}
   
   The constraint analysis in this section is performed for a **fixed baseline MTOW of 10.00 kg**, 
   derived from the payload-driven mass allocation in @sec:mass-fractions. This is a reference case 
   study, not a closed-loop sizing result. The matching chart identifies feasible design space 
   regions and constraint interactions; absolute geometry and power values are conditional on the 
   assumed MTOW.
   
   To ensure fair comparison across configurations, the following parameters are held constant:
   
   * Payload mass: 1.00 kg (camera + radio relay)
   * MTOW: 10.00 kg (baseline value)
   * Battery mass fraction: 35% (3.50 kg battery mass)
   * Battery technology: HV LiPo, 270 Wh/kg specific energy
   * Depth of discharge: 80%
   * Energy reserve: 20%
   * Hover time allocation: 2 min (takeoff + landing)
   * Transition time allocation: 1 min (two 30-s transitions)
   
   The energy constraint is verified by explicit mission energy budget evaluation at the 
   candidate design point, rather than plotted as a separate constraint line. This approach 
   is appropriate for the fixed disk loading baseline case where energy feasibility depends 
   on mission segment durations rather than wing loading.
   ```
3. Update any language in the "Design point determination" subsection to use "baseline design point" terminology.
4. Repeat equivalent changes in the Italian section file (`sections_it/05_04_...`).

**Verification:**
- [ ] Baseline case definition subsection added to English manuscript
- [ ] Baseline case definition subsection added to Italian manuscript
- [ ] "Design point" language updated to "baseline design point"
- [ ] Manuscript builds without errors (`build_docx.bat`)

---

### 2. Ensure payload constraint is applied and communicated correctly

**Objective:** Verify that the payload mass is a binding constraint and is visibly documented in the manuscript.

* Confirm that the baseline case uses `mission.mass.payload_kg = 1.0` and `mission.mass.mtow_kg = 10.0` with consistent mass fractions in `src/mars_uav_sizing/config/mission_parameters.yaml`.
* Add a "payload feasibility" statement in Section 4 or Section 5 clarifying that the payload mass is a fixed mission constraint and is included in the mass allocation.
* Ensure that any discussion of "optimising MTOW" is confined to future work unless a configuration-specific closure is implemented and validated.

**Practical steps:**

1. **Verify configuration file:**
   ```powershell
   # Check current values
   Get-Content src\mars_uav_sizing\config\mission_parameters.yaml | Select-String -Pattern "payload_kg|mtow_kg|f_payload"
   ```
   Expected output:
   - `payload_kg: 1.0`
   - `mtow_kg: 10.0`
   - `f_payload: 0.10`
   Verify that `payload_kg / f_payload = mtow_kg` (i.e., 1.0 / 0.10 = 10.0 kg).

2. **Add payload feasibility statement to manuscript:**
   In `sections_en/04_11_mass-fractions.md` (or appropriate Section 4 file), add:
   ```markdown
   The payload mass of 1.00 kg is a **fixed mission constraint** derived from the selected 
   camera and radio relay components (@sec:payload-systems). The baseline MTOW of 10.00 kg 
   follows directly from the payload mass and the assumed payload mass fraction:
   
   $$M_\text{MTOW} = \frac{M_\text{payload}}{f_\text{payload}} = \frac{1.00}{0.10} = 10.00 \text{ kg}$$
   
   This payload-driven sizing ensures that the mission payload requirement is satisfied by 
   construction. Any configuration that cannot carry 1.00 kg within the 10.00 kg MTOW 
   envelope is infeasible.
   ```

3. **Audit manuscript for "optimising MTOW" language:**
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem sections_en\*.md | Select-String -Pattern "optim|minim|size-to|closure" -CaseSensitive:$false
   ```
   If any results suggest closed-loop sizing, reword to clarify that this is a baseline case or move to future work.

4. **Repeat for Italian sections.**

**Verification:**
- [ ] `mission_parameters.yaml` values confirmed consistent
- [ ] Payload feasibility statement added to Section 4
- [ ] No misleading "optimising MTOW" language in baseline case sections
- [ ] Italian manuscript synchronised

---

### 3. Make energy accounting consistent across configurations (honest feasibility)

**Objective:** Ensure all three configurations use identical energy accounting assumptions for fair comparison.

* Confirm that all three configurations apply the same reserve policy (`mission.energy.reserve_fraction`) and battery utilisation (`dod`, `eta_discharge`) when computing endurance.
* Confirm that rotorcraft and hybrid VTOL include explicit hover energy for `t_hover_s`.
* For hybrid VTOL, ensure that transition energy is either modelled (with clear assumptions) or explicitly bounded, and that the manuscript states which approach is used.
* Update any manuscript numbers to 4 significant figures and ensure consistency with the current code outputs.

**Practical steps:**

1. **Audit energy parameters in code:**
   ```powershell
   # Check battery parameters
   Get-Content src\mars_uav_sizing\config\battery_parameters.yaml | Select-String -Pattern "dod|eta_discharge|reserve"
   Get-Content src\mars_uav_sizing\config\mission_parameters.yaml | Select-String -Pattern "reserve_fraction"
   ```

2. **Audit each analysis module for energy consistency:**
   Review the following files to confirm they use the same energy accounting:
   - `src/mars_uav_sizing/section5/rotorcraft.py`
   - `src/mars_uav_sizing/section5/fixed_wing.py`
   - `src/mars_uav_sizing/section5/hybrid_vtol.py`
   
   Check that each:
   - Uses `get_param('mission.energy.reserve_fraction')` (not hardcoded values)
   - Uses `get_param('battery.depth_of_discharge')` and `get_param('battery.eta_discharge')`
   - Computes available energy as: `E_total × DoD × η_discharge × (1 - reserve)`

3. **Confirm hover energy accounting:**
   - Rotorcraft: Check that `t_hover_s` is read from config and hover energy is subtracted.
   - Hybrid VTOL: Check that hover energy + transition energy are subtracted before cruise endurance.
   - Fixed-wing: Confirm hover is not applicable (or explicitly stated as zero).

4. **Audit transition energy model:**
   In `src/mars_uav_sizing/section5/hybrid_vtol.py`, confirm the transition energy model:
   ```python
   # Expected pattern:
   E_trans = E_ref × (m_UAV / m_ref) × mars_factor
   ```
   If the model is simplified, ensure the manuscript states this clearly (Action Step 1 should include this).

5. **Cross-check manuscript numbers against code output:**
   Run the analysis and compare key values:
   ```powershell
   cd src\mars_uav_sizing
   python -m mars_uav_sizing.run_analysis > ..\..\reports\baseline_check.txt 2>&1
   ```
   Compare with values in:
   - `sections_en/05_02_rotorcraft-analysis.md` (or equivalent)
   - `sections_en/05_03_fixed-wing-analysis.md`
   - `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md`

6. **Update manuscript with 4 significant figures:**
   Any discrepancies should be corrected to match the code output (code is authoritative for stated assumptions).

**Verification:**
- [ ] All three configurations use identical energy accounting
- [ ] Hover energy explicitly accounted for rotorcraft and hybrid VTOL
- [ ] Transition energy model documented in manuscript
- [ ] Manuscript numbers match code output to 4 significant figures

---

### 4. Correct report generation for reproducibility and manuscript integration

**Objective:** Generate clean, reproducible reports that can be directly referenced.

* Generate a single "baseline case" report from `src/mars_uav_sizing/run_analysis.py` and save it under `reports/` with a stable naming scheme (date-time and mode).
* Ensure report headers match the actual mode (avoid "COUPLED" headers when running uncoupled code paths).
* Ensure report output is UTF-8 clean and does not contain non-standard glyphs that impede manuscript copy-paste.

**Practical steps:**

1. **Fix header mismatch issue:**
   The current report shows "MARS UAV FEASIBILITY STUDY (COUPLED)" but the analysis is uncoupled.
   
   Locate the header generation code:
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem src\mars_uav_sizing -Recurse -Filter "*.py" | Select-String -Pattern "COUPLED" -CaseSensitive
   ```
   
   Fix the header to correctly identify the mode. The header should read:
   ```
   MARS UAV FEASIBILITY STUDY (BASELINE CASE)
   Section 5: Constraint Analysis
   Mode: UNCOUPLED - Fixed MTOW = 10.00 kg
   ```

2. **Fix UTF-8 encoding issues:**
   The box-drawing characters (╔, ═, ━) are rendering as mojibake.
   
   Option A (Recommended): Replace Unicode box-drawing with ASCII alternatives:
   ```python
   # Replace
   print("╔" + "═" * 78 + "╗")
   # With
   print("+" + "=" * 78 + "+")
   ```
   
   Option B: Ensure proper encoding when writing to file:
   ```python
   with open(report_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
       ...
   ```
   And ensure PowerShell/terminal uses UTF-8:
   ```powershell
   [Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
   ```

3. **Update report naming scheme:**
   Modify `run_analysis.py` to save reports with a clear naming convention:
   ```python
   timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S")
   report_name = f"baseline_case_{timestamp}.txt"
   report_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / "reports" / report_name
   ```

4. **Generate authoritative baseline report:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\matti\OneDrivePhD\Dev\Drone_marte
   python -m mars_uav_sizing.run_analysis 2>&1 | Out-File -Encoding utf8 reports\baseline_case_authoritative.txt
   ```

5. **Verify report is clean:**
   Open the report in a text editor and confirm:
   - No mojibake characters
   - Header correctly identifies "BASELINE CASE" or "UNCOUPLED"
   - All numerical values are formatted consistently

**Verification:**
- [ ] Report header correctly identifies mode
- [ ] No UTF-8 encoding issues in report output
- [ ] Report saved with stable naming scheme
- [ ] Report can be opened and read in any text editor without corruption

---

### 5. Reconcile figures and tables with code outputs

**Objective:** Ensure all figures and tables match the code outputs for the baseline case.

* Regenerate the matching chart figure used in `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md` and ensure it corresponds to the baseline assumptions (fixed MTOW and fixed disk loading) and to the numbers reported in `@tbl:design-point` and `@tbl:design-parameters`.
* Confirm that any comparative figures (`@fig:ld-comparison`, `@fig:endurance-comparison`) are generated from the same baseline configuration and are not mixing coupled and uncoupled results.

**Practical steps:**

1. **Identify figure generation scripts:**
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem src\mars_uav_sizing -Recurse -Filter "*.py" | Select-String -Pattern "savefig|plt\.save" -CaseSensitive:$false
   ```

2. **Regenerate all Section 5 figures:**
   ```powershell
   cd src\mars_uav_sizing
   python -m mars_uav_sizing.visualization.generate_all_figures
   ```
   (Or run individual figure generation scripts if a master script doesn't exist.)

3. **Verify figure parameters match tables:**
   Cross-check `@fig:matching-chart` annotations against `@tbl:design-point`:
   - Hover constraint line at P/W = 85.71 W/N
   - Stall constraint line at W/S = 14.42 N/m²
   - Design point marker at intersection

4. **Check comparative figures for consistency:**
   Confirm that the values shown in `@fig:ld-comparison`, `@fig:power-comparison`, and `@fig:endurance-comparison` match:
   - Rotorcraft: L/D = 4.0, endurance = 63.17 min
   - Fixed-wing: L/D = 11.68, endurance = 120.5 min
   - Hybrid VTOL: L/D = 10.52, endurance = 89.55 min

5. **Update figure files:**
   Copy regenerated figures to the manuscript figures directory:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item src\mars_uav_sizing\output\figures\*.png sections_en\figures\ -Force
   Copy-Item src\mars_uav_sizing\output\figures\*.png sections_it\figures\ -Force
   ```

6. **Verify figures render in manuscript:**
   ```powershell
   .\reconstruct.bat
   .\build_docx.bat
   ```
   Open the output DOCX and confirm all figures display correctly.

**Verification:**
- [ ] All Section 5 figures regenerated from current code
- [ ] Figure annotations match table values
- [ ] No mixing of coupled/uncoupled results in comparative figures
- [ ] Figures render correctly in DOCX output

---

### 6. Verification loop (required before manuscript rebuild)

**Objective:** Run automated verification and reconcile any mismatches.

* Run manuscript verification checks using `src/mars_uav_sizing/verification/verify_manuscript.py` and reconcile any mismatches by updating either:
  * the manuscript text and tables, if the code is authoritative for the stated assumptions
  * the YAML configuration, if the manuscript states a different assumption
* Rebuild the manuscript using `reconstruct.bat` and confirm that cross-references, equations, and figures render correctly in `build_docx.bat`.

**Practical steps:**

1. **Run verification script:**
   ```powershell
   cd src\mars_uav_sizing
   python -m mars_uav_sizing.verification.verify_manuscript
   ```

2. **Review verification output:**
   The script will report:
   - `[PASS]` for values within tolerance (default 0.5%)
   - `[FAIL]` for values outside tolerance
   
   For each `[FAIL]`:
   - If code is authoritative: update manuscript value
   - If manuscript states different assumption: update YAML config

3. **Apply tolerance criterion:**
   All numerical values must match within **0.5%** relative error.
   For binary/categorical values (e.g., "feasible"), exact match is required.

4. **Document any configuration changes:**
   If YAML config is modified, add a comment explaining the change:
   ```yaml
   # Updated 2025-12-30 per verification loop (was 0.35, corrected to 0.355)
   f_battery: 0.355
   ```

5. **Rebuild manuscript:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\matti\OneDrivePhD\Dev\Drone_marte
   .\reconstruct.bat
   .\build_docx.bat
   ```

6. **Check build log for issues:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content build_docx.log | Select-String -Pattern "undefined|missing|warning" -CaseSensitive:$false
   ```

7. **Final visual inspection:**
   Open the output DOCX and spot-check:
   - Cross-references resolve correctly
   - Equations render correctly
   - Figures display correctly
   - Tables are properly formatted

**Verification:**
- [ ] `verify_manuscript.py` reports all `[PASS]`
- [ ] No undefined cross-references in build log
- [ ] DOCX output opens without errors
- [ ] Visual inspection confirms correct rendering

---

### 7. Italian manuscript synchronisation (NEW)

**Objective:** Ensure Italian manuscript sections reflect all changes made to English sections.

**Practical steps:**

1. **Identify corresponding Italian files:**
   For each English section file modified in steps 1–6, locate the Italian equivalent:
   - `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md` → `sections_it/05_04_...`
   - `sections_en/04_11_mass-fractions.md` → `sections_it/04_11_...`

2. **Translate new content:**
   For the baseline case definition subsection (Step 1), translate to Italian:
   ```markdown
   ### Definizione del caso di riferimento {#sec:baseline-case}
   
   L'analisi dei vincoli in questa sezione è eseguita per un **MTOW di riferimento fisso 
   di 10,00 kg**, derivato dall'allocazione di massa basata sul payload in @sec:mass-fractions. 
   Si tratta di uno studio di caso di riferimento, non di un risultato di dimensionamento 
   ad anello chiuso. ...
   ```

3. **Verify all numerical values are identical:**
   Numbers should not be translated—they must match exactly between English and Italian.

4. **Rebuild Italian manuscript:**
   ```powershell
   .\build_docx.bat it
   ```

5. **Check for consistency:**
   Compare section structure between English and Italian to ensure they match.

**Verification:**
- [ ] All modified English sections have corresponding Italian updates
- [ ] Numerical values identical between languages
- [ ] Italian manuscript builds without errors

---

### 8. Update Section 2 (Design Methodology) for clarity (NEW)

**Objective:** Clarify that Section 2 correctly describes the methodology, and that this manuscript represents the **first iteration** of the described 4-phase cycle. Also document configuration-specific constraint spaces.

**Assessment of current Section 2:**

The methodology described in Section 2 (4-phase iterative sizing) is accurate and consistent with the manuscript structure:

| Phase | Described in §2 | Manuscript Status |
|:------|:----------------|:------------------|
| 1. Initial hypotheses | Reference data, scaling from Earth designs | ✓ Section 4 complete |
| 2. Preliminary sizing | Matching chart → design point | ✓ Section 5 complete |
| 3. Component selection | Actual components from datasheets | ◐ Section 7 partial |
| 4. Verification | Recalculate with actual values | ◐ Code exists, integration pending |

**Conclusion**: Section 2 does NOT need to be rewritten. The methodology is correct; we're executing the first iteration. Only minor clarifications and additions are needed.

**Issues to address:**

| Issue | Action needed |
|:------|:--------------|
| Generic "P/W vs W/S" chart description | Add note on configuration-specific constraint spaces |
| No "current status" statement | Add brief note indicating first-iteration scope |
| No explicit feasibility criteria | Already addressed in Step 1 (baseline case definition) |

**Practical steps:**

1. **Update §2.2 to acknowledge configuration-specific constraint spaces:**

   In `sections_en/02_02_role-of-constraint-based-sizing-sec-constraint-role.md`, after line 5, add clarification:

   ```markdown
   The constraint space axes depend on the configuration under study:
   
   * For pure rotorcraft without a wing, the relevant axes are power loading (P/W) 
     versus disk loading (DL), with the hover constraint from actuator disk theory 
     as the primary bound (@sec:rotorcraft-analysis).
   * For fixed-wing aircraft, the classic P/W versus W/S axes apply, with cruise 
     and stall constraints defining the feasible region (@sec:fixed-wing-analysis).
   * For hybrid VTOL aircraft, the P/W versus W/S axes are used with both hover 
     (appearing as a horizontal line) and wing-related constraints combined 
     (@sec:hybrid-vtol-analysis).
   ```

2. **Add a brief "study status" note at the end of §2.1:**

   In `sections_en/02_01_iterative-sizing-approach-sec-iterative-sizing.md`, after the figure, add:

   ```markdown
   This manuscript documents the first pass through the iterative cycle. Phases 1 
   and 2 (initial hypotheses and preliminary sizing) are fully developed in 
   Sections 4 and 5. Component selection (Phase 3) and final verification (Phase 4) 
   are addressed in Sections 7 and 9, completing the first iteration at the baseline 
   MTOW of 10.00 kg. Subsequent iterations would refine the MTOW and other parameters 
   based on component-level constraints.
   ```

3. **(Optional) Add unverified items disclosure to §2 or Conclusions:**

   List aspects not modelled in this first iteration (packaging, thermal margins, 
   stability, manufacturing). This can be in Section 2 or deferred to Conclusions.

4. **Repeat equivalent updates for Italian sections.**

**Note**: This step does NOT suggest that Section 2 is wrong. The methodology description is accurate; we're simply clarifying the current iteration status and adding configuration-specific constraint space documentation.

**Verification:**
- [ ] §2.2 documents configuration-specific constraint spaces
- [ ] §2.1 includes "first iteration" status note
- [ ] Italian sections updated
- [ ] Manuscript builds without errors

---




## Deferred future work (improved approach, not required for this study)

This subsection is intended to be added to conclusions or future work, without changing the baseline-case results.

* Implement **configuration-specific coupled closures**:
  * rotorcraft closure: solve for MTOW and battery mass given payload mass, disk loading, hover time, cruise time, and energy reserve
  * fixed-wing closure: solve for MTOW and battery mass given payload mass, chosen `W/S`, cruise speed policy, and energy reserve
  * hybrid VTOL closure: solve for MTOW and battery mass given payload mass, `DL`, `W/S`, mission segment times, transition energy model, and energy reserve
* Replace fixed mass fractions with a **minimal component-based mass model** for at least battery, payload, propulsion, and structure, and add a plausibility constraint on payload fraction using the reference drone database.
* Add **parametric sweeps** in disk loading (`DL`) and mission times to the hybrid VTOL analysis.
* Report results as **minimum feasible MTOW** (or maximum margin) subject to all mission constraints, and clearly separate design variables from requirements.

**Note**: Configuration-appropriate constraint diagrams (P/W vs DL for rotorcraft, P/W vs W/S for fixed-wing and hybrid VTOL) are already implemented in the baseline case and are NOT deferred.

## Acceptance criteria (baseline case)

* A reader can reproduce all Section 5 numeric results by running `src/mars_uav_sizing/run_analysis.py` with the committed YAML inputs.
* Any feasible label is backed by an explicit payload statement, an energy budget check (including reserve), and the endurance requirement check.
* The manuscript does not mix coupled and uncoupled results in the same baseline-case tables or claims.
