• You’re basically right to be suspicious, but there’s a nuance:

  - The manuscript’s matching-chart section is explicitly a single baseline case at MTOW = 10.00 kg (see
    sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md:135). That’s why it can turn the chart into
    absolute numbers like S = 2.574 m², P_hover = 3181 W, etc. It’s a scenario, not a closed-loop “size-to-requirement”
    result.
  - The “uncoupled” code (src/mars_uav_sizing/) mirrors that: it uses one global MTOW (mission.mass.mtow_kg) and one
    global battery fraction (mission.mass_fractions.f_battery) for all three configurations. So the comparisons are
    “given the same 10 kg vehicle with the same battery fraction, what endurance/range do the three architectures
    produce?”
  - The matching chart in code is essentially the QuadPlane chart (src/mars_uav_sizing/section5/matching_chart.py).
    Rotorcraft and fixed-wing analyses don’t literally reuse that chart; they reuse the same global assumptions (MTOW,
    battery fraction, disk loading, speeds, etc.). So your understanding is close, but it’s more “single baseline mass
    model shared across configs” than “one matching chart reused for all.”

  On “should we have three different matching charts?”:

  - Yes, if the goal is an architecture trade study based on constraint diagrams, you need configuration-specific
    constraint diagrams.
  - They are not the same object:
      - Rotorcraft: the natural constraint plot is P/W vs DL (disk loading), not P/W vs W/S.
      - Fixed-wing: classic P/W vs W/S (cruise, stall, takeoff/landing/climb as needed).
      - Hybrid VTOL: P/W vs W/S with a hover line + cruise curve + stall line (and, if you want to be honest about
        feasibility, an energy/endurance boundary too).

  On “uncoupled vs coupled”:

  - Uncoupled is fine as a first-pass physics/constraint picture (matching charts are often done “weight-free” in terms
    of P/W and W/S), but you must treat endurance margins as conditional on the assumed battery fraction and MTOW.
  - The current “coupled” package (src/mars_uav_sizing_coupled/) is a good start for internal consistency (it closes
    MTOW/battery mass against mission energy), but it currently computes one coupled solution and then uses that same
    solved MTOW/battery mass when reporting rotorcraft and fixed-wing too. That makes the rotorcraft/fixed-wing numbers
    not “those architectures sized to meet the mission”; it’s “those architectures evaluated at the hybrid-sized mass
    state”, which is not an apples-to-apples trade.

  What I would do (best practice for your manuscript logic):

  - Pick the comparison basis explicitly:
      - Option A (baseline trade study): keep MTOW fixed (e.g., 10 kg) and compare endurance/range → your current
        uncoupled approach is acceptable, but call it “baseline case”, not “sized design”.
      - Option B (sizing-driven trade study, usually better): for each architecture, solve “what MTOW (and battery mass)
        is required to meet the same mission + payload?” → this requires three separate coupled closures, one per
        configuration.
  - If you want a “third improved approach”: do architecture-specific coupled closure + sweep of the true design knobs
    (rotorcraft: DL; fixed-wing: W/S; hybrid: DL and W/S) to generate feasible regions and pick the minimum-MTOW (or
    maximum margin) point. That produces the most defensible “we selected hybrid VTOL because…” argument.

  If you want, I can implement Option B cleanly: three coupled solvers (or a robust fixed-point iteration) and three
  configuration-appropriate constraint plots, without changing the manuscript assumptions unless you decide to.

## Purpose and scope

This plan defines the minimum set of actions required to produce a mission-driven and internally consistent feasibility study using the baseline-case methodology (fixed reference MTOW) and to document a deferred, improved methodology as future work.

The target outcome is a manuscript that:

* reports results that are reproducible from the current sizing code
* states feasibility conditions and limitations explicitly (payload and energy constraints included)
* avoids presenting exploratory coupled sizing results as final design results

the goal is an architecture trade study based on constraint diagrams, you need configuration-specific constraint diagrams.
  - They are not the same object:
      - Rotorcraft: the natural constraint plot is P/W vs DL (disk loading), not P/W vs W/S.
      - Fixed-wing: classic P/W vs W/S (cruise, stall, takeoff/landing/climb as needed).
      - Hybrid VTOL: P/W vs W/S with a hover line + cruise curve + stall line (and, if you want to be honest about
        feasibility, an energy/endurance boundary too).

  - Uncoupled is fine as a first-pass physics/constraint picture (matching charts are often done “weight-free” in terms
    of P/W and W/S), but you must treat endurance margins as conditional on the assumed battery fraction and MTOW.

baseline trade study: keep MTOW fixed (e.g., 10 kg) and compare endurance/range → your current uncoupled approach is acceptable, but call it “baseline case”, not “sized design”.


## Key decisions (record)

* Baseline case is retained for this feasibility study: the comparative analysis is performed at a fixed reference MTOW justified in Section 4.
* Mission constraints are treated as non-negotiable requirements, including payload mass and endurance.
* Energy feasibility is treated as necessary for any configuration labelled feasible, including reserve and non-cruise phases.
* A configuration-specific coupled sizing workflow (improved approach) is deferred to future work and is not required for feasibility-study completion.

## Working definition of “feasible” (necessary and sufficient for this study)

For a configuration to be labelled feasible in the baseline case, all items below must be satisfied simultaneously under the same set of assumptions:

* Payload: the mission payload mass is carried as a fixed mass term in the mass model, and the baseline MTOW allocation remains consistent with the assumed mass fractions in Section 4.
* VTOL: configurations that do not satisfy the VTOL requirement are labelled not feasible regardless of endurance.
* Energy: the mission energy budget including hover, transition allowance, cruise, battery depth of discharge, discharge efficiency, and reserve fraction is satisfied.
* Endurance and range: the computed mission endurance and range satisfy the requirement thresholds.

If a condition is not modelled (for example, packaging volume, thermal margins, controllability, actuator sizing), it must be stated as an unverified item

## Current state audit (inputs and code authority)

  - The manuscript’s matching-chart section is explicitly a single baseline case at MTOW = 10.00 kg (see
    sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md:135). That’s why it can turn the chart into
    absolute numbers like S = 2.574 m², P_hover = 3181 W, etc. It’s a scenario, not a closed-loop “size-to-requirement”
    result.
  - The “uncoupled” code (src/mars_uav_sizing/) mirrors that: it uses one global MTOW (mission.mass.mtow_kg) and one
    global battery fraction (mission.mass_fractions.f_battery) for all three configurations. So the comparisons are
    “given the same 10 kg vehicle with the same battery fraction, what endurance/range do the three architectures
    produce?”
  - The matching chart in code is essentially the QuadPlane chart (src/mars_uav_sizing/section5/matching_chart.py).
    Rotorcraft and fixed-wing analyses don’t literally reuse that chart; they reuse the same global assumptions (MTOW,
    battery fraction, disk loading, speeds, etc.). So your understanding is close, but it’s more “single baseline mass
    model shared across configs” than “one matching chart reused for all.”

* Manuscript results in Section 5.4 are expressed for a baseline `MTOW = 10.00 kg` and use that MTOW to compute absolute geometry and installed power (`S`, `b`, `P`), see `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md`.
* Uncoupled code path (authoritative for baseline case): `src/mars_uav_sizing/`.
* Coupled code path (exploratory, not yet suitable for baseline-case manuscript numbers): `src/mars_uav_sizing_coupled/` currently solves one coupled state and reuses it across configurations, which is not a mission-fair comparison across architectures.

## Deliverables

* Updated manuscript sections that match the uncoupled code outputs and state feasibility conditions precisely
* Reproducible baseline report generated from `src/mars_uav_sizing/run_analysis.py` and stored under `reports/` with an unambiguous label and UTF-8-safe output.
* A future-work subsection describing the deferred “improved approach” without changing the current feasibility-study scope.

## Action steps (baseline case completion)

### 1. Align definitions, assumptions, and terminology in the manuscript

* Add a short paragraph in `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md` stating explicitly that the matching-chart design point is evaluated at a fixed baseline MTOW (reference case), and that it is not a closed-loop sizing result.
* Add a short paragraph in `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md` stating that the energy constraint is verified by an explicit mission energy budget evaluation at the candidate design point, and is not plotted as a separate constraint line for the fixed disk loading baseline case.
* Add a short paragraph in `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md` stating what is held constant across configurations in the baseline comparison (payload mass, MTOW, battery technology assumptions, reserve policy, mission time allocations).

### 2. Ensure payload constraint is applied and communicated correctly

* Confirm that the baseline case uses `mission.mass.payload_kg = 1.0` and `mission.mass.mtow_kg = 10.0` with consistent mass fractions in `src/mars_uav_sizing/config/mission_parameters.yaml`.
* Add a “payload feasibility” statement in Section 4 or Section 5 clarifying that the payload mass is a fixed mission constraint and is included in the mass allocation.
* Ensure that any discussion of “optimising MTOW” is confined to future work unless a configuration-specific closure is implemented and validated.

### 3. Make energy accounting consistent across configurations (honest feasibility)

* Confirm that all three configurations apply the same reserve policy (`mission.energy.reserve_fraction`) and battery utilisation (`dod`, `eta_discharge`) when computing endurance.
* Confirm that rotorcraft and hybrid VTOL include explicit hover energy for `t_hover_s`.
* For hybrid VTOL, ensure that transition energy is either modelled (with clear assumptions) or explicitly bounded, and that the manuscript states which approach is used.
* Update any manuscript numbers to 4 significant figures and ensure consistency with the current code outputs.

### 4. Correct report generation for reproducibility and manuscript integration

* Generate a single “baseline case” report from `src/mars_uav_sizing/run_analysis.py` and save it under `reports/` with a stable naming scheme (date-time and mode).
* Ensure report headers match the actual mode (avoid “COUPLED” headers when running uncoupled code paths).
* Ensure report output is UTF-8 clean and does not contain non-standard glyphs that impede manuscript copy-paste.

### 5. Reconcile figures and tables with code outputs

* Regenerate the matching chart figure used in `sections_en/05_04_matching-chart-methodology-sec-comparative-results.md` and ensure it corresponds to the baseline assumptions (fixed MTOW and fixed disk loading) and to the numbers reported in `@tbl:design-point` and `@tbl:design-parameters`.
* Confirm that any comparative figures (`@fig:ld-comparison`, `@fig:endurance-comparison`) are generated from the same baseline configuration and are not mixing coupled and uncoupled results.

### 6. Verification loop (required before manuscript rebuild)

* Run manuscript verification checks using `src/mars_uav_sizing/verification/verify_manuscript.py` and reconcile any mismatches by updating either:
  * the manuscript text and tables, if the code is authoritative for the stated assumptions
  * the YAML configuration, if the manuscript states a different assumption
* Rebuild the manuscript using `reconstruct.bat` and confirm that cross-references, equations, and figures render correctly in `build_docx.bat`.

## Deferred future work (improved approach, not required for this study)

This subsection is intended to be added to conclusions or future work, without changing the baseline-case results.

* Implement configuration-specific coupled closures:
  * rotorcraft closure: solve for MTOW and battery mass given payload mass, disk loading, hover time, cruise time, and energy reserve
  * fixed-wing closure: solve for MTOW and battery mass given payload mass, chosen `W/S`, cruise speed policy, and energy reserve
  * hybrid VTOL closure: solve for MTOW and battery mass given payload mass, `DL`, `W/S`, mission segment times, transition energy model, and energy reserve
* Replace fixed mass fractions with a minimal component-based mass model for at least battery, payload, propulsion, and structure, and add a plausibility constraint on payload fraction using the reference drone database.
* Produce configuration-appropriate constraint diagrams:
  * rotorcraft: `P/W` vs `DL`
  * fixed-wing: `P/W` vs `W/S` with relevant constraints
  * hybrid VTOL: `P/W` vs `W/S` plus parametric sweeps in `DL` and mission times
* Report results as minimum feasible MTOW (or maximum margin) subject to all mission constraints, and clearly separate design variables from requirements.

## Acceptance criteria (baseline case)

* A reader can reproduce all Section 5 numeric results by running `src/mars_uav_sizing/run_analysis.py` with the committed YAML inputs.
* Any feasible label is backed by an explicit payload statement, an energy budget check (including reserve), and the endurance requirement check.
* The manuscript does not mix coupled and uncoupled results in the same baseline-case tables or claims.
