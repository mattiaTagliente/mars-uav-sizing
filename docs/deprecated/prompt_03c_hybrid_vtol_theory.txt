================================================================================

This prompt follows the THREE-PHASE workflow:

PHASE A: THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT (THIS PROMPT)
   - Combine hover analysis (from §5.2) and cruise analysis (from §5.3)
   - Develop the UNIQUE energy storage constraint
   - Analyze the mass penalty trade-off
   - Use [TO BE CALCULATED] placeholders for numerical results

   - Implement scripts that EXACTLY reproduce manuscript equations

PHASE C: NUMERICAL RESULTS (subsequent task)
   - Run scripts, insert results, generate figures

THIS PROMPT COVERS PHASE A ONLY.

================================================================================
CONTEXT
================================================================================

You are developing Section 5.4 of the Mars UAV feasibility study:
"Hybrid VTOL configuration analysis"

This section analyzes whether a hybrid VTOL (QuadPlane) configuration can
satisfy ALL Mars UAV mission requirements:
- 50 km operational radius ✓
- 60-90 minute cruise endurance ✓
- VTOL capability ✓

The QuadPlane combines:
- Lift rotors (from rotorcraft) → VTOL capability
- Wing + cruise motor (from fixed-wing) → Efficient cruise

SPOILER: The analysis will show that hybrid VTOL IS FEASIBLE, but requires
careful energy budget management and accepts a mass penalty for dual propulsion.

This is the ONLY configuration that satisfies all constraints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: QUADPLANE ARCHITECTURE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 CONFIGURATION DESCRIPTION

The QuadPlane configuration consists of:

LIFT SYSTEM (for hover):
- 4+ electric rotors (quadcopter layout)
- Sized for hover ONLY (short duration)
- Positioned to minimize interference with wing

CRUISE SYSTEM (for forward flight):
- Wing for lift generation
- Single pusher or tractor propeller
- Sized for efficient cruise

DECOUPLED OPTIMIZATION:
- Lift rotors: optimized for thrust, not forward flight
- Wing + cruise prop: optimized for L/D, not hover
- Each system operates in its optimal regime

CITE: Search for QuadPlane or hybrid VTOL references:
- Bertani 2023 Mars VTOL paper (@bertaniPreliminaryDesignFixedwing2023)
- Commercial QuadPlane documentation (DeltaQuad, Wingtra)

1.2 FLIGHT PHASES

| Phase | Propulsion | Lift Source | Duration |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Takeoff | Lift rotors | Rotor thrust | ~30s |
| Transition | Both | Rotors → Wing | ~30s |
| Cruise | Cruise motor | Wing | ~60 min |
| Transition | Both | Wing → Rotors | ~30s |
| Landing | Lift rotors | Rotor thrust | ~30s |

Total hover time: ~2-3 minutes
Total cruise time: ~57-58 minutes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: HOVER CONSTRAINT (LIFT SYSTEM)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 REFERENCE TO ROTORCRAFT ANALYSIS

The hover power equations are identical to those in @sec:rotorcraft-analysis.

From @eq:hover-power:
$$P_{hover} = \frac{W^{3/2}}{FM \times \sqrt{2\rho A_{rotor}}}$$

Electrical power:
$$P_{electric,hover} = \frac{P_{hover}}{\eta_{motor,lift} \times \eta_{ESC}}$$

2.2 KEY DIFFERENCE: HOVER DURATION

For rotorcraft: hover duration = entire mission (60+ min)
For QuadPlane: hover duration = t_hover ≈ 180 s (takeoff + landing + contingency)

This dramatically reduces the energy required for hover.

2.3 HOVER ENERGY

Energy consumed during hover phases:
$$E_{hover} = P_{electric,hover} \times t_{hover}$$ {#eq:hover-energy-qp}

EXAMPLE (placeholder):
- P_hover = [TO BE CALCULATED] W
- t_hover = 180 s = 0.05 h
- E_hover = [TO BE CALCULATED] Wh

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: CRUISE CONSTRAINT (WING SYSTEM)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 REFERENCE TO FIXED-WING ANALYSIS

The cruise power equations are identical to those in @sec:fixed-wing-analysis.

From @eq:cruise-power:
$$P_{cruise} = \frac{W \times V}{(L/D) \times \eta_{prop}}$$

Electrical power:
$$P_{electric,cruise} = \frac{P_{cruise}}{\eta_{motor,cruise} \times \eta_{ESC}}$$

3.2 QUADPLANE AERODYNAMIC EFFICIENCY

The QuadPlane achieves fixed-wing L/D during cruise because:
- Lift rotors are stopped/folded (no drag penalty)
- Or: Minor drag penalty from stationary rotors

Expected L/D: 12-15 (similar to pure fixed-wing)

If rotors add parasite drag:
(L/D)_QuadPlane ≈ 0.90 × (L/D)_pure = 0.90 × 15 = 13.5

3.3 CRUISE ENERGY

Energy consumed during cruise:
$$E_{cruise} = P_{electric,cruise} \times t_{cruise}$$ {#eq:cruise-energy-qp}

EXAMPLE (placeholder):
- P_cruise = [TO BE CALCULATED] W
- t_cruise = 3600 s = 1.0 h (60 min)
- E_cruise = [TO BE CALCULATED] Wh

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: ENERGY STORAGE CONSTRAINT (CRITICAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS IS THE UNIQUE CONSTRAINT FOR HYBRID VTOL.

4.1 TOTAL ENERGY REQUIREMENT

The battery must provide energy for ALL phases:
$$E_{required} = E_{hover} + E_{cruise} + E_{reserve}$$ {#eq:energy-required}

Expanding:
$$E_{required} = P_{hover} \times t_{hover} + P_{cruise} \times t_{cruise} + E_{reserve}$$ {#eq:energy-required-expanded}

4.2 RESERVE POLICY

The energy reserve accounts for:
- Navigation uncertainty
- Headwinds
- Contingency operations
- Battery degradation margin

Standard reserve: 20% of mission energy
$$E_{reserve} = 0.20 \times (E_{hover} + E_{cruise})$$ {#eq:reserve}

Total with reserve:
$$E_{required} = 1.20 \times (E_{hover} + E_{cruise})$$ {#eq:energy-with-reserve}

CITE: Search for UAV energy reserve requirements. If no source, state "20%
reserve is adopted as a conservative margin consistent with aviation practice."

4.3 AVAILABLE ENERGY

From battery:
$$E_{available} = m_{batt} \times e_{spec} \times DoD \times \eta_{batt}$$ {#eq:energy-available}

Using battery mass fraction:
$$E_{available} = f_{batt} \times MTOW \times e_{spec} \times DoD \times \eta_{batt}$$

4.4 ENERGY CONSTRAINT

The mission is feasible if:
$$E_{available} \geq E_{required}$$ {#eq:energy-constraint}

Expanding:
$$f_{batt} \times MTOW \times e_{spec} \times DoD \times \eta_{batt} \geq 1.20 \times (P_{hover} \times t_{hover} + P_{cruise} \times t_{cruise})$$

4.5 BATTERY FRACTION CONSTRAINT

Rearranging to find minimum battery fraction:
$$f_{batt} \geq \frac{1.20 \times (P_{hover} \times t_{hover} + P_{cruise} \times t_{cruise})}{MTOW \times e_{spec} \times DoD \times \eta_{batt}}$$ {#eq:f-batt-min}

This constraint couples:
- Power requirements (P_hover, P_cruise)
- Mission profile (t_hover, t_cruise)
- Battery technology (e_spec)
- Mass allocation (f_batt)

4.6 CONSTRAINT ON MATCHING CHART

The energy constraint can be expressed as:
$$\left(\frac{E}{W}\right)_{required} \leq \left(\frac{E}{W}\right)_{available}$$

This is an ADDITIONAL constraint beyond hover and cruise power constraints.

On matching chart, it manifests as a FEASIBLE REGION boundary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5: MASS PENALTY ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1 DUAL PROPULSION MASS

The QuadPlane carries mass for BOTH propulsion systems:

LIFT SYSTEM MASS:
- Lift motors: N_lift × m_motor,lift
- Lift ESCs: N_lift × m_ESC,lift
- Lift propellers: N_lift × m_prop,lift
- Mounting structure: m_mount

$$m_{lift,system} = N_{lift} \times (m_{motor} + m_{ESC} + m_{prop}) + m_{mount}$$

CRUISE SYSTEM MASS:
- Cruise motor: m_motor,cruise
- Cruise ESC: m_ESC,cruise
- Cruise propeller: m_prop,cruise

$$m_{cruise,system} = m_{motor,cruise} + m_{ESC,cruise} + m_{prop,cruise}$$

5.2 MASS PENALTY CALCULATION

For a pure fixed-wing, only cruise system is needed.
The QuadPlane adds the entire lift system.

Mass penalty:
$$\Delta m = m_{lift,system}$$ {#eq:mass-penalty}

As fraction of MTOW:
$$f_{penalty} = \frac{m_{lift,system}}{MTOW}$$

EXPECTED VALUES (from reference UAV data):
- N_lift = 4 motors
- m_motor,lift ≈ 0.2-0.3 kg each
- m_ESC,lift ≈ 0.05-0.1 kg each
- Total lift motors + ESC: 1.0-1.6 kg for 4 units
- Mounting structure: 0.2-0.5 kg
- Total m_lift,system ≈ 1.5-2.5 kg

For MTOW = 4 kg:
f_penalty = 1.5 / 4 = 0.375 (37.5%) ← significant!

For MTOW = 10 kg:
f_penalty = 2.0 / 10 = 0.20 (20%) ← more reasonable

RESEARCH: Extract propulsion mass from reference_drones.yaml for calibration.

5.3 MASS PENALTY TRADE-OFF

The mass penalty is ACCEPTABLE because:
1. Enables VTOL capability (critical requirement)
2. Distributed over entire MTOW
3. Does not prevent mission feasibility

Without VTOL: mission is impossible (no takeoff)
With VTOL: mission is possible with penalty

"The dual propulsion mass penalty of approximately [X]% of MTOW is accepted
as the enabling factor for the Mars UAV mission, which has no alternative
means of vertical takeoff and landing."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6: COMBINED CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 CONSTRAINTS SUMMARY

The QuadPlane must satisfy ALL constraints simultaneously:

| Constraint | Equation | Type |
|------------|----------|------|
| Hover power | P/W ≥ f(DL, FM, ρ) | Minimum P/W |
| Cruise power | P/W ≥ f(V, L/D, η) | Minimum P/W |
| Stall | W/S ≤ f(ρ, V_min, C_L,max) | Maximum W/S |
| Energy | E ≥ E_required | Coupling constraint |

6.2 MATCHING CHART CONSTRUCTION

The matching chart for QuadPlane plots:
- X-axis: Wing loading W/S (N/m²)
- Y-axis: Power loading P/W (W/N or W/kg)

Constraints on chart:
1. Hover constraint: HORIZONTAL LINE (independent of W/S)
   - Determined by disk loading of lift rotors
   
2. Cruise constraint: CURVE
   - Higher P/W at very low W/S (high C_L, induced drag)
   - Higher P/W at very high W/S (flying fast to maintain lift)
   - Minimum P/W at optimal W/S

3. Stall constraint: VERTICAL LINE
   - Maximum W/S for given V_min, C_L,max, ρ

4. Energy constraint: REGION BOUNDARY
   - Couples P/W and mission time
   - May exclude otherwise feasible regions

FEASIBLE REGION:
- Above hover constraint
- Above cruise constraint
- Left of stall constraint
- Within energy constraint

DESIGN POINT:
- Minimum P/W within feasible region
- Or: Maximum W/S (smallest wing) satisfying all constraints

6.3 EXPECTED DESIGN POINT

Based on preliminary analysis, expect:
- W/S ≈ 5-10 N/m² (very low, Mars constraint)
- P/W ≈ 20-40 W/kg (high, Mars hover constraint)
- Hover-dominated: P/W set by hover, not cruise

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 7: FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.1 ENERGY BUDGET EXAMPLE

For MTOW = 4 kg:

A) Available energy:
   E_avail = 0.35 × 4 × 250 × 0.80 × 0.95 = 266 Wh

B) Hover energy:
   P_hover = [TO BE CALCULATED] W
   t_hover = 180 s = 0.05 h
   E_hover = [TO BE CALCULATED] Wh

C) Cruise energy:
   P_cruise = [TO BE CALCULATED] W
   t_cruise = 3600 s = 1.0 h
   E_cruise = [TO BE CALCULATED] Wh

D) Required energy (with 20% reserve):
   E_required = 1.20 × (E_hover + E_cruise) = [TO BE CALCULATED] Wh

E) Feasibility check:
   E_avail ≥ E_required → [TO BE VERIFIED]

7.2 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

What if E_required > E_available?

Options to restore feasibility:
a) Reduce cruise time (smaller radius)
b) Increase battery fraction (reduce payload)
c) Reduce MTOW (iterate design)
d) Improve (L/D) (aerodynamic refinement)
e) Increase battery specific energy (future technology)

7.3 DESIGN ITERATIONS

The QuadPlane design is inherently coupled:
- MTOW affects P_hover and P_cruise
- Wing area affects W/S and stall
- Battery fraction affects range and MTOW

Iteration procedure:
1. Assume MTOW
2. Check constraints
3. Adjust parameters
4. Repeat until converged

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 8: FEASIBILITY CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1 SUMMARY TABLE

| Requirement | QuadPlane Capability | Status |
|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| 60-90 min endurance | ~[TO BE CALCULATED] min | ✓ PASS |
| 50 km radius | ~[TO BE CALCULATED] km | ✓ PASS |
| VTOL | Yes (lift rotors) | ✓ PASS |

8.2 CONCLUSION

The hybrid VTOL (QuadPlane) configuration IS FEASIBLE for the Mars UAV mission.

It is the ONLY configuration that satisfies all three critical requirements:
1. **VTOL capability** from lift rotors (unlike fixed-wing)
2. **Cruise endurance** from efficient wing (unlike pure rotorcraft)
3. **Energy feasibility** through decoupled optimization

The configuration accepts a mass penalty of approximately [X]% for the dual
propulsion system. This penalty is the enabling cost of mission feasibility.

**Recommendation: Select hybrid VTOL (QuadPlane) as the baseline configuration
for detailed design in Section 6.**
