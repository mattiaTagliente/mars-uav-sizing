    mars_uav_considerations:
      note: |
        The Götten C_f,eq = 0.0128 is for terrestrial UAVs at higher Reynolds numbers.
        For Mars UAV at Re ~ 60,000, skin friction is higher due to:
        1. Lower Reynolds number increases C_f
        2. Transition effects at low Re
        However, the Mars UAV will likely have:
        1. Cleaner aerodynamic design (no EO turrets, simpler landing gear)
        2. Fixed VTOL rotors add some additional drag

    mars_uav_implications:
      note: |
        Mars UAV will not have:
        - Fixed landing gear (VTOL from habitat)
        - Large EO turret (smaller camera payload)
        Therefore, C_f,eq closer to lower values is appropriate.

# 5. COMPARISON WITH AIRFOIL L/D DATA
# =============================================================================

validation:
  comparison_with_airfoil_data:
    note: |
      The aircraft (L/D)_max of ~15 is lower than the airfoil (L/D)_max of 46.6 for E387.
      This is expected because:
      1. Aircraft C_D0 includes fuselage, tail, and interference drag
      2. Airfoil data is 2D; aircraft is 3D with induced drag
      3. Aircraft operates at different C_L than airfoil (L/D)_max condition
    
    airfoil_e387:
      ld_max_2d: 46.6
      cl_at_ld_max: 1.20
      cd_at_ld_max: 0.026
    
    aircraft_ar_12:
      ld_max_3d: 15.3
      cl_at_ld_max: 0.92
      cd_at_ld_max: 0.060
    
    ratio: 3.0
    interpretation: |
      Aircraft L/D is ~3× lower than 2D airfoil L/D, which is typical for 
      small aircraft. The additional drag sources (fuselage, tail, 
      interference, induced drag) reduce overall aerodynamic efficiency.
