  theory:

    description: |
      Actuator disk theory defines ideal hover power as P_ideal = T^1.5 / sqrt(2*rho*A).
      Figure of merit is the ratio of ideal to actual power, always < 1.
      FM accounts for profile drag, non-uniform inflow, and tip losses.

    notes: |
      Rotating wing MAVs at very low Reynolds numbers. 
      FM typically 0.3-0.4 compared to 0.82 for full-scale.
      Profile drag coefficients ~0.035 at low Re (vs ~0.01 at high Re).

    notes: |
      Mars rotors operate at Re=11,000 (MH) to Re=15,000-25,000 (MSH).
      Combined effects of low Re and high Mach (0.7-0.9 at tips).

    notes: |
      Ingenuity operational FM not directly published.
      Design used CAMRAD II for rotor performance predictions.
      Hover power ~350 W total system for 1.8 kg, confirmed operationally.
  
  # Recommended value for sizing
  recommended:
    value: 0.50
    rationale: |
      Conservative estimate for Mars conditions based on:
      1. MAV data shows FM ~ 0.3-0.5 at very low Reynolds (Leishman)
      2. Mars adds high Mach number effects not present in Earth MAV tests
      3. Johnson MSH study used calibrated CAMRAD II models
      Value of 0.50 is conservative middle of expected range.
    uncertainty: 0.10
    sensitivity: "Hover power scales as 1/FM; 10% FM error = 10% power error"

      to Cd0~0.03-0.04 at Re~30,000-60,000.
      This directly impacts propeller efficiency.
  
  # Recommended value for sizing
  recommended:
    value: 0.55
    rationale: |
      Conservative estimate for Mars cruise propeller based on:
      1. Low Reynolds operation (Re ~ 50,000-100,000)
      2. Profile drag increase at low Re
      3. Uncertainty in Mars propeller design
      Higher values (0.60-0.65) possible with optimized design.
    uncertainty: 0.10

    description: |
      Brushless DC (BLDC) motors are highly efficient.
      Typical UAV motor efficiency: 80-95%.
      Efficiency varies with operating point (torque, speed).
      Peak efficiency typically at 70-80% of maximum power.
  
  # Peak efficiency
  peak_efficiency:
    value: 0.90
    value_range: [0.88, 0.92]
    load_point: "70-80% of max power, optimal torque/speed"
    source_key: "@t-motorMN505SKV260Brushless2024"
    source_location: "T-Motor product specifications (typical BLDC values)"
    notes: |
      High-quality brushless motors achieve 88-92% peak efficiency.
      T-Motor, SunnySky motors used in reference drones are in this class.
  
  # Cruise efficiency (partial load)
  cruise_efficiency:
    value: 0.87
    value_range: [0.83, 0.90]
    load_point: "40-60% of max power"
    source_key: null
    source_location: null
    notes: |
      Efficiency slightly reduced at partial load.
      Still high for quality BLDC motors.
  
  # Hover efficiency (high load)
  hover_efficiency:
    value: 0.85
    value_range: [0.82, 0.88]
    load_point: "80-100% of max power"
    source_key: null
    source_location: null
    notes: |
      High load operation may slightly reduce efficiency.
      Motors sized for hover will operate near peak efficiency.
  
  # Mars-specific considerations
  mars_considerations:
    cold_start: |
      Mars temperatures (-60°C to +20°C surface) may affect:
      - Winding resistance (lower at cold = higher efficiency)
      - Bearing friction (lubricant viscosity issues)
      - Magnet strength (permanent magnets affected by temperature)
    thermal_management: |
      Thin atmosphere provides poor convective cooling.
      Motor heating may be an issue in extended operation.
    net_effect: "Overall motor efficiency expected similar to Earth values"
  
  # Recommended value for sizing
  recommended:
    value: 0.85
    rationale: |
      Conservative average across operating envelope.
      Motor efficiency relatively unaffected by Mars atmosphere.
      0.85 accounts for variation between cruise and hover.
    uncertainty: 0.03
    sensitivity: "Power from battery = P_shaft / η_motor"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ESC EFFICIENCY
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
esc_efficiency:
  definition: "η_ESC = P_motor_in / P_battery_out"
  
  # General characteristics
  general_characteristics:
    description: |
      Electronic Speed Controllers regulate power to motors.
      Efficiency varies with throttle setting.
      Modern ESCs are highly efficient at high throttle.
  
  # Typical values
  typical_value:
    value: 0.95
    value_range: [0.90, 0.98]
    operating_condition: "High throttle (> 70%)"
    source_key: null  # Web search results on ESC efficiency
    source_location: null
    notes: |
      High-quality ESCs achieve 95-98% at high throttle.
      Efficiency drops at low throttle (< 50%).
      For hover/cruise applications, high throttle expected.
  
  # Throttle dependence
  throttle_effect:
    full_throttle: "96-98% efficiency"
    cruise_throttle: "93-95% efficiency (moderate throttle)"
    low_throttle: "80-90% efficiency (< 50% throttle)"
    notes: |
      ESC efficiency varies with PWM duty cycle.
      Switching losses dominate at partial throttle.
  
  # Recommended value for sizing
  recommended:
    value: 0.95
    rationale: |
      Conservative value for sizing calculations.
      Hover and cruise operate at moderate-high throttle.
      Quality ESCs maintain high efficiency in this range.
    uncertainty: 0.02
    sensitivity: "Relatively minor impact vs FM and η_prop"

# COMBINED EFFICIENCIES (for constraint analysis)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
combined_efficiency:
  hover_chain:
    formula: "η_hover_total = FM × η_motor × η_ESC"
    components:
      figure_of_merit: 0.50
      motor_efficiency: 0.85
      esc_efficiency: 0.95
    calculated_value: 0.404  # 0.50 × 0.85 × 0.95 = 0.404
    notes: |
      Total efficiency from battery to hover thrust.
      Actual thrust power = Battery power × 0.40 approximately.
      This is a conservative estimate for Mars conditions.
  
  cruise_chain:
    formula: "η_cruise_total = η_prop × η_motor × η_ESC"
    components:
      propeller_efficiency: 0.55
      motor_efficiency: 0.85
      esc_efficiency: 0.95
    calculated_value: 0.444  # 0.55 × 0.85 × 0.95 = 0.444
    notes: |
      Total efficiency from battery to cruise thrust power.
      Actual thrust power = Battery power × 0.44 approximately.
      Cruise efficiency slightly higher than hover due to propeller vs rotor.
