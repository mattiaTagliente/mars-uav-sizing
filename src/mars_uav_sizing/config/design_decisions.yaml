# FUSELAGE GEOMETRY SELECTION (§6.3)
# ==============================================================================
# Reference data from §4.8:
#   - Commercial VTOL benchmark range: 0.28-0.63
#   - Median: 0.50
#   - DeltaQuad Evo (flying wing): 0.28
#   - RTV320 E: 0.63
#
# TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS:
# Shorter fuselage (lower ratio):
#   + Less fuselage structural mass
#   + Less fuselage wetted area (drag)
#   - Requires boom extension for tail moment arm
#   - Less internal volume margin
#
# Longer fuselage (higher ratio):
#   + More fuselage lift contribution
#   + Longer tail moment arm without boom extension
#   + More internal volume for payload growth
#   - More fuselage structural mass
#   - More fuselage wetted area
#
# Design decision: Use lower benchmark (0.30)
# Rationale: Internal volume requirement (4-5 L) is far less than 170 L
# provided by 0.50 ratio. Boom-mounted tail provides moment arm independently.

fuselage:
  # Selected length-to-wingspan ratio (lower benchmark)
  length_to_span_ratio: 0.30
  
  # Fineness ratio (from aerodynamic literature)
  fineness_ratio: 6.0           # L/D, for low-drag profile
  
  # Computed dimensions (from b = 4.01 m):
  #   L_fus = 0.30 × 4.01 = 1.20 m
  #   D_fus = L_fus / 6 = 0.20 m
  #   V_fus = π/4 × D² × L = 0.038 m³ = 38 L
  length_m: 1.20                # Computed from ratio × wingspan
  diameter_m: 0.20              # Computed from length / fineness
  height_with_gear_m: 0.50      # Ground clearance for rotors
  
  # Total aircraft length including boom extension
  boom_extension_m: 1.05        # Tail support structure aft of fuselage
  total_length_m: 2.25          # Nose to tail trailing edge

# ==============================================================================
# AIRFOIL SELECTION (§6.2)
# ==============================================================================
# Reference data from §4.7:
#   - E387: CL_max 1.21, good low-Re performance
#   - SD8000: CL_max 1.15, larger stall margin
#
# Design decision: SD8000 selected
# Rationale: Larger stall margin (4.6° vs 1.3°) provides safety margin
# for Mars operations where recovery from stall is difficult.

airfoil:
  selected: SD8000
  cl_max: 1.15                  # From Selig wind tunnel data
  cd_min: 0.0142                # At design Re ≈ 55,000
  stall_margin_deg: 4.6         # α_stall - α_design

# ==============================================================================
# CONFIGURATION SELECTION (§6.1)
# ==============================================================================
# Reference data from §5 comparative analysis:
#   - Rotorcraft: Fails endurance requirement
#   - Fixed-wing: Fails VTOL requirement
#   - Hybrid VTOL: Meets all requirements
#
# Design decision: QuadPlane (hybrid VTOL) selected

configuration:
  type: quadplane
  n_lift_rotors: 8              # Octocopter for redundancy
  n_cruise_props: 1             # Single pusher
  wing_mounted: true            # Not tilt-rotor
