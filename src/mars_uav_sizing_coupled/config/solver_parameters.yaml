# Mars UAV Sizing (Coupled) - Solver Parameters
# ============================================
# Engineering seeds and solver settings for coupled constraint solving.
# Seeds are defined from Section 4 and treated as fixed starting points.
# Any tuning should be handled as a subsequent iteration per Section 2.
