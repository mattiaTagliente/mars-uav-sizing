## Structural materials {#sec:materials-data}

Commercial VTOL UAVs predominantly use composite materials for primary structure, with carbon fiber providing the best strength-to-weight ratio. The following table summarizes available material data from manufacturer specifications.

| UAV | Primary materials | Notes |
|:----|:------------------|:------|
| AirMobi V25 | Carbon fiber, fiberglass, Kevlar, PVC | Modular design, tool-free assembly |
| AirMobi V32 | Carbon fiber, fiberglass, Kevlar, PVC | Similar construction to V25 |
| V13-5 Sentinel | Carbon fiber, fiberglass, Kevlar | Heavy-lift configuration |
| Elevon X Sierra | Prepreg carbon fiber composites | CNC-machined molds, monocoque hull |
| DeltaQuad Evo | Composite (unspecified) | Flying wing construction |

The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter employed advanced carbon fiber composites for its rotor blades and structure, using TeXtreme spread tow carbon fabrics for ultralight weight and resistance to microcracking under Martian temperature cycling [@latourabOxeonPartOwnedHoldings2025]. The landing legs and fuselage protection also used carbon fiber reinforced composites, with gold-coated interior surfaces for thermal management.

For Mars applications, material selection must address the thermal cycling from −80°C to +20°C diurnal variation, the low atmospheric pressure that eliminates convective heat transfer, and radiation exposure (approximately 76 mGy/year surface dose), all while minimizing mass and maintaining structural integrity.
