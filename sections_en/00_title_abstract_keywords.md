This study evaluates the feasibility of deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from a crewed habitat on Mars to extend exploration range beyond surface mobility limits. The design employs a QuadPlane hybrid architecture combining vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capability with efficient fixed-wing cruise. A battery-only configuration with a target MTOW of 10 kg is selected, prioritizing simplicity and reliability for the challenging Mars environment. Operating from Arcadia Planitia at −3 km elevation, the low atmospheric density (0.0196 kg/m³) necessitates large wing areas and high-efficiency propulsion, resulting in Reynolds numbers of 50,000–90,000 where airfoil selection becomes critical. The SD8000 airfoil is selected for its consistent low-drag characteristics and robust stall margin at these conditions. The final design achieves 90 min endurance with 49% margin, a 4.01 m wingspan, and 2.69 m² wing area. Preliminary sizing indicates the design is technically feasible with current or near-term technology.
