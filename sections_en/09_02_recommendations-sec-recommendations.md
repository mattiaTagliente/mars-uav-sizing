# Conclusions and recommendations

## Recommendations {#sec:recommendations}

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made for the preliminary design phase:

1. Proceed with QuadPlane architecture: the octocopter lift system with coaxial cruise propeller configuration offers the best balance of performance, reliability, and operational flexibility
2. Technology development: prioritize improved battery specific energy (>200 Wh/kg) for significant performance gains in future iterations
3. Airfoil validation: wind tunnel testing of the SD8000 airfoil at Mars-representative Reynolds numbers is warranted to confirm the low-speed aerodynamic predictions
4. Dust mitigation: surface contamination effects on rotor and wing performance require investigation, particularly for long-duration surface operations
