This study evaluates the feasibility of a UAV designed to support the operations of a crewed outpost on Mars, providing aerial reconnaissance, geological survey, and communication relay capabilities.

Atmospheric flight on Mars presents distinct challenges compared to terrestrial aviation. The Martian atmosphere has approximately 1% of Earth's sea-level density, requiring large wing and rotor surfaces, higher flight speeds, or a combination of both to generate sufficient aerodynamic forces. Mars gravity (3.711 m/s²), at 38% of Earth's value, reduces the lift required to sustain flight and partially offsets this density penalty. The absence of atmospheric oxygen precludes combustion-based propulsion; electric motors driving rotors or propellers provide the only practical means of powered flight. The lack of prepared runways at exploration sites necessitates vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capability. Dust storms and local wind shear require a flight control system with sufficient bandwidth and authority to reject atmospheric disturbances. Fine Martian regolith accumulates on exposed surfaces and degrades mechanical and optical components, requiring protected storage and active cleaning systems such as compressed air jets in a hangar airlock. Finally, the thin atmosphere and absence of a global magnetic field expose the surface to elevated solar and galactic cosmic radiation, demanding radiation-tolerant electronics or appropriate shielding.

The successful flights of NASA's Ingenuity helicopter demonstrated that powered flight on Mars is achievable [@tzanetosIngenuityMarsHelicopter2022]<!-- #abs -->. However, Ingenuity's rotorcraft architecture limits range and endurance. For exploration missions requiring coverage of tens to hundreds of kilometers, fixed-wing aircraft offer higher aerodynamic efficiency. This study examines hybrid VTOL configurations that combine the operational flexibility of rotorcraft with the cruise efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft.
