## Operations concept {#sec:operations-concept}

A typical operational day:

1. Pre-flight check (habitat interior, 30 min)
2. Transfer to airlock (10 min)
3. Airlock depressurization (5 min)
4. VTOL takeoff and mission execution (60–120 min)
5. VTOL landing at airlock (5 min)
6. Airlock repressurization (5 min)
7. Post-flight inspection and charging (60 min)

With two flight-ready UAVs, daily operations are feasible with alternating flights and charging cycles.
