# Reference data and trade-off analysis

## Mars UAV concepts {#sec:mars-uav-concepts}

Several Mars UAV concepts have been proposed or demonstrated, providing reference data for initial design hypotheses.

NASA Ingenuity is a 1.8 kg rotorcraft that demonstrated autonomous powered flight on Mars, completing 72 flights with cumulative flight time of approximately 129 minutes [@tzanetosIngenuityMarsHelicopter2022; @nasaIngenuityMarsHelicopter2024]. Ingenuity validated technologies including autonomous navigation, rotor performance in thin atmosphere, and thermal survival through Martian nights.

ARES was a proposed 175 kg fixed-wing aircraft with rocket propulsion, designed for regional survey missions covering over 600 km at 1-2 km altitude [@braunDesignARESMars2006]. ARES was a finalist in NASA's Mars Scout program but was not selected for flight.

The Mars Science Helicopter concepts are proposed 20-30 kg hexacopters as Ingenuity successors for extended range operations, demonstrating the trend toward larger rotorcraft with greater payload capacity [@johnsonMarsScienceHelicopter2020].

Recent investigations into hybrid VTOL concepts for Mars fixed-wing VTOL architectures include a preliminary design addressing aerodynamic and propulsion challenges of the transition phase [@bertaniPreliminaryDesignFixedwing2023], and a solar-powered drone concept with wingspan and aspect ratio optimized via a multidisciplinary sizing tool [@barbatoPreliminaryDesignFixedWing2024].

These reference designs inform mass fractions, disk loading values, and performance expectations. Ingenuity provides validation that powered flight on Mars is achievable; ARES demonstrates that fixed-wing architectures were considered viable for regional-scale missions; the Mars Science Helicopter concepts show the path toward increased capability beyond technology demonstration; and the hybrid VTOL studies offer specific aerodynamic and sizing methodologies for architectures combining efficient cruise with vertical flexibility.
