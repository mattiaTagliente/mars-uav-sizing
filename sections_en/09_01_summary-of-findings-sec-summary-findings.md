# Conclusions and recommendations

## Summary of findings {#sec:summary-findings}

The study evaluated three candidate architectures—rotorcraft, fixed-wing, and hybrid VTOL—through constraint-based sizing analysis. Key findings include:

* The QuadPlane hybrid architecture provides an effective compromise between VTOL capability and cruise efficiency, achieving a 49% energy margin over mission requirements
* Low Reynolds number effects (Re ≈ 55,000) significantly impact aerodynamic design; the SD8000 airfoil offers consistent low-drag performance with adequate stall margin (4.6°)
* Hover power dominates motor sizing; fixed-wing cruise power is substantially lower than hover power, favoring configurations that minimize hover duration
* Current battery technology (150 Wh/kg) enables practical mission durations of approximately 90 minutes with 20% reserve
* The pure rotorcraft configuration is marginally feasible but offers limited operational margin; the fixed-wing configuration is not feasible without runway infrastructure
