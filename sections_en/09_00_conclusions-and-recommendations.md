# Conclusions and recommendations

*[This section will summarize the feasibility study findings and provide recommendations. Content to be updated once the design is finalized.]*

Key findings:

* The QuadPlane hybrid architecture provides an effective compromise between VTOL capability and cruise efficiency
* Low Reynolds number effects significantly impact aerodynamic design; the E387 airfoil offers good performance at Re = 50,000–90,000
* Hover power dominates motor sizing; fixed-wing cruise power is substantially lower than hover power
* Current battery technology (150 Wh/kg) enables practical mission durations

Recommendations:

1. **Technology development**: Prioritize improved battery specific energy (>200 Wh/kg) for significant performance gains
2. **Airfoil validation**: Wind tunnel testing of selected airfoils at Mars-representative Reynolds numbers is warranted
3. **Thermal design**: Detailed thermal analysis for the extreme Mars diurnal temperature range is required
4. **Dust mitigation**: Surface contamination effects on rotor performance require investigation

The Mars UAV concept is technically feasible with current or near-term technology.
