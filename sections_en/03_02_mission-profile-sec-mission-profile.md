# Mission analysis

## Mission profile {#sec:mission-profile}

The mission radius is defined as the maximum distance the UAV can travel outbound while retaining sufficient energy to return with 20% reserve. This accounts for navigation errors, wind effects, and contingency maneuvers.

A reference mission profile is designed consisting of seven phases. The UAV performs a vertical take-off using lift rotors to ascend to cruise altitude, then transitions to fixed-wing flight by accelerating until the wings generate sufficient lift. During cruise outbound, the aircraft flies in fixed-wing mode to the target area at cruise speed. Upon arrival, the vehicle enters a loiter or survey phase with payload systems active for area coverage. The cruise return phase mirrors the outbound leg, with fixed-wing flight back to the habitat. Finally, the aircraft decelerates and transitions back to vertical flight mode before completing a vertical landing on the designated pad.
